      "   \\t1\\tGji      Hi all, When I was asked for the script of ANDHADHUN, I wondered which version makes the most sense. Because we had so many.  ANDHADHUN took it’s basic inspiration from the French short film, Le Accordeur.  That film ends on a solid tense situation but somehow I found it very funny. That was the nucleus. A blind man playing the piano as a man and woman dispose of a dead body in dumb charades. We had to construct a back story and a forward story from this madcap situation.   We have dozens of versions of the story and script. Some abandoned halfway, coz they were leading nowhere. Some so typical that we rejected them outright. In one version, Akash was a music teacher in a Pune school and had no lofty artistic aspirations. In another, Sophie and Pramod’s daughter merged into one character. In a third, a blind Akash enlisted the building kid’s help, to PRETEND he could see. The blind rabbit came into existence after three or four drafts. Once we were stuck on a scene and couldn’t crack it. By chance, an actor who had come for an audition told us a story that cracked our scene. I always wonder, what if he hadn’t come that day. We brainstormed a lot, that’s one of the main advantages of collaborative writing. We also argued and fought a lot.  What you read below is an in between draft. Somethings will be in full detail….and some just broad strokes.   All writing is rewriting….! We began ‘writing’ sometime in 2013….and we finished the last rewrite in July 2018. We were in Poland and kept reworking on the last scene between Akash and Sophie. Funnily, the last shot in the film was also the last shot on the last day of the film’s shoot.

A naked man looking around \\ncuriously. He smells the air. \\nBehind him the space ship camouflaged in a cloud. Flash of \\ndull lightning appear from it \\nWe see a pair of feet on the barren land. The feet cautiously \\nmove forward to reveal a naked alien’s back.\\nThe only object on the alien’s body is a small stone-like \\nround device tied with a metallic thread on his neck. \\nHe touches it...\\n.... and the cloud rises up.\n",
