"FADE IN:
EXT. SPACE
Like conscious observers on a galactic LSD trip, we careen 
through a wormhole, bursting into a gaseous nebula, through a 
brilliant kaleidoscope of light’s infinite spectra, and into 
space, where distant stars - pinholes in a black canvas - 
illuminate the darkness. 
We emerge at the edge of the swirling Milky Way galaxy, past 
remote planets, past Jupiter, through Saturn’s rings, 
approaching a tiny blue light on the horizon: HOME. 
CLOSER
Earth’s moon in full view, the speed abates. Earth - a 
turquoise jewel in space - grows brighter: a ball, a sphere, 
a globe, a world. We’re propelled into Earth’s atmosphere.
A pervasive hum pulses with crackling, sizzling SNAPS, like 
hot high voltage wires, ripping the silence of the heavens. 
INSIDE EARTH’S ATMOSPHERE 
Through a dense net of satellites and human space junk. The 
pulsed hum intensifies. 
Over North America and then Alaska, where we zoom in above a 
sinister array of electrical towers and massive antennae, 
spread over acres of cement ground, in the middle of no man’s 
land. 
Bolts of electrical lightning explode, like whips of hot 
flames.
The unbearable crackling, sizzling sounds pulsate to the 
sequential rhythm of deliberately-generated disruption. 
EXT. UNDERWATER
We plunge into the ocean.
Haunting WHALE CALLS echo through the deep, where an 
illuminated, underwater alien colony comes into focus. 
Luminous deep sea creatures, giant neon jellyfish and other 
unrecognizable life forms surround motherships and smaller 
craft, docked in ports between the great ships. It’s a 
veritable city of lights, hidden at the bottom of the Great 
Pacific.
A hatch opens, shooting light beams across the sea floor.
DISSOLVE TO:"
"2.EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - GHIRARDELLI SQUARE - DAY (1975)
The sun. We follow its oblique rays out over the park lawn. 
“SUPERIMPOSE”: SAN FRANCISCO - 1975
A MIME performs to the delight of SPECTATORS. In the 
background, noisy SEALS BARK incessantly from the waterfront.
INT. VICTORIAN HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY 
Light beams seep out from under a crack below a door, at the 
top of the stairs. We hear the sweet sounds of tinkling WIND 
CHIMES, and a child giggling, engaged in conversation. Sun 
pours through a stained glass rainbow peace sign in the 
window, reflecting down the stairs. 
There’s a poster - the immortalized street signs at the 
corner of Haight and Ashbury - on the downstairs wall.
AMANDA HASTINGS, a Sax Fifth Avenue hippie (25), appears from 
the kitchen in designer embroidered bell bottoms and a clingy 
halter top, braless. Her fresh-faced beauty is enhanced by 
ornate beaded earrings and wild flowers woven into a long 
braid of chestnut hair, reaching all the way down her back.
She’s headed to the living room with a cup of tea, when she 
hears her daughter chattering away upstairs. She climbs the 
stairs and opens the door.
INT. VICTORIAN HOUSE - JAMIE’S BEDROOM - DAY
The room is awash in crazy, bold colors. Turquoise walls are 
painted in swirls of ocean waves. A brightly lacquered mobile 
of tropical fish hangs from a purple ceiling.
Amanda stands in the doorway, watching her five-year-old 
daughter, JAMIE, a sunny, exuberant little pixie, on the 
floor, coloring. She’s got the most incredible, enormous blue 
eyes - as blue and as deep as the ocean itself. 
Amanda sips her tea, adoring her daughter.
AMANDA
Who you talking to, angel baby?
Jamie hands her the drawing. It’s an extraordinary rendering - 
the immense, piercing eye of a humpback whale. 
CLOSE UP: WE MOVE THROUGH THE WHALE’S EYE.
FADE TO BLACK.
FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)
I’m zapped.2."
"3.MALE VOICE (V.O)
Three more and we call it a day.
We hear a CLICK - the slide tray of a projector.
FEMALE VOICE (V.O)
A tower. The Eiffel Tower? Yeah. 
That’s it.
CLICK. 
FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)
That’s easy: Rubik’s cube.
CLICK.
FEMALE VOICE (V.O.
I’m getting a black beard ... Uh. I 
don’t know. I’m tired. I can’t see 
anymore for today. 
MALE VOICE (V.O.)
That’s great, Jamie. We’re done. 
You can remove the blindfold.
FADE IN ON:
INT. STANFORD PSYCHIC INSTITUTE - RESEARCH LAB - DAY (1995)
A geeky male RESEARCHER in wire-rimmed glasses, stands next 
to a projector, behind a glass partition.
Twenty-five-year-old Jamie is seated behind a window in a 
soundproof room. She bears an amazing resemblance to her 
mother. There’s an inner beauty, shining through the oceans 
of those intense, blue eyes.
The bearded face of Che Guevara is projected onto a screen 
behind her. 
Jamie removes the blindfold and leans into the mic.
JAMIE
How did I do?
He gives her a thumbs up and smiles. She turns to look at the 
screen.
JAMIE(CONT'D)
Che? Gheesh! How yesterday.
He flips the switch on the projector.
RESEARCHER
(into Mic)
Well done! You’ve beaten every 
record.3."
"4.INT. LAPD HEADQUARTERS - MAIN HALL - DAY (PRESENT)
A big digital clock on the wall behind the desk marks the 
date: JUNE 22, 2012. 
A few HOOKERS and a strung-out CRACK HEAD sit waiting to be 
booked. 
The POLICEWOMAN (30) behind the desk looks like Rambo in 
drag. She smiles warmly when she sees Jamie, now fifty-years-
old.
POLICEWOMAN
Jamie. 
They shake hands. Jamie pulls a bag out of her tote and 
places it on the counter.
JAMIE
Amanda’s blueberry pecan muffins.
The policewoman opens it up and breathes in the scent.
POLICEWOMAN
God, we missed you around here.
JAMIE
I’m only visiting. Is he in there?
The policewoman nods, tending to phones ringing off the hook. 
Jamie walks past her to an open door, CHIEF MARTIN KASZLOW 
stenciled on the glass window.  
Surrounded by stacks of files, dirty coffee mugs and a half-
empty box of doughnuts, KASZLOW stares at the computer. He’s 
fifty pounds overweight and looks like he slept in his 
clothes for a week. 
Wiping the sweat with a grimy handkerchief, he spots Jamie 
peeking in.
INT. LAPD HEADQUARTERS - THE CHIEF’S OFFICE - DAY
He rolls back his chair and stands to greet her. Jamie 
enters, hugs him, and takes a seat next to the desk.
JAMIE
You look like hell, Marty.
MARTIN
Murder Central will do that. 
JAMIE
“Murder Central.” Jesus. 
Martin pulls three handwritten messages from a stack of notes 
stuck on a pin and hands them to her.4."
"5.MARTIN
People are looking for you. I’m 
afraid your success in Lahore is 
already insider’s news. This guy, 
Mat Anderson, called several times. 
He’s big. CEO of USOIL. 
JAMIE
Yeah, well, I’m done dowsing for 
oil, that’s for sure. I’m taking an 
extended vacation, on the other 
side of the earth, where not even 
you can find me.
He picks up the phone.
MARTIN
(into phone)
Hold my calls.
(to Jamie)
Two wells. You really outdid 
yourself this time, James.
JAMIE
Yeah, well, somehow it feels like 
it’s coming back to bite me in the 
ass.
She crinkles the notes and throws them into the bin.
MARTIN
I had to give him your number, 
sorry about that. I got pressure 
from way up high. The guy’s 
connected. Powerful people. Be 
careful. 
He reaches into the overflowing trash bin, pulls out the 
note, and stuffs it into her blouse pocket.
JAMIE
You could have simply sent me a 
message. So, why am I really here? 
I could have sworn we agreed I was 
no longer available for murder one. 
MARTIN
I need you, James.
Martin slides a ziplock bag across the desk. In it, there’s a 
macabre photo of a dead African-American girl, covered in 
blood, with a sharp sliver of hard plastic rammed into her 
jugular vein. The only other thing in the bag is the killer’s 
signature: a plastic chess piece. 
It’s the black king. 5."
"6.MARTIN(CONT'D)
Chess Man is back. This time he 
left us the weapon. Looks like he’s 
stepping up his game. 
Jamie stares up at the wall where photos of every victim are 
lined up.
MARTIN(CONT'D)
Sixteen white pieces - sixteen dead 
white girls. He’s into the black 
pieces now - and lo and behold 
we’ve got our first black body. 
He’s telling us there are fifteen 
more to come.
Jamie reaches for it with trepidation, staring at the photo. 
JAMIE
I can’t bear this anymore. Did I 
mention that?
MARTIN
You did. 
She retrieves the chess piece and places it in her left palm. 
In the other she holds the chunk of plastic. Her eyes closed, 
she slumps down in the chair. Almost immediately, she 
struggles to breathe - hyperventilating.
SERIES OF SHOTS - JAMIE’S PSYCHIC VISIONS:
A)  The bloated, mutilated naked body of a young African-                             
American woman, face down in a creek. 
B)  A beat-up Studebaker pickup, parked in the driveway of a 
dilapidated trailer in the woods. 
C)  The word, CHECKMATE, scrawled across the front page of 
the L.A. TIMES, jammed into a dark, blood-stained wall with a 
hunting knife.
BACK TO SCENE.
Eyes closed, Jamie rubs her forehead, like she’s trying to 
summon a genie. Martin watches, anxiously.
JAMIE
Okay, I’m getting something. A 
tattoo: Ring. Bad ring? He’s got a 
ring? It’s a blur. Come on, let me 
see this. Black ring? Wait. Of 
course! That’s him - The BLACK 
KING. That’s your man.
She opens her eyes and stares at the chess piece in her hand.6."
"7.JAMIE(CONT'D)
He’s the black king, get it?
Excitedly, Martin searches the criminal database, typing on 
the keyboard: TATTOO - BLACK KING. 
Two faces appear on the screen: a young black gangbanger, 
BLACK KING tattooed on his right bicep: incarcerated. And a 
fifty-six-year-old Caucasian male: WILLIE HYNES. He’s out 
free. Tattooed on his chest in block letters: THE BLACK KING.
Shivering, Jamie points at Hynes.
JAMIE(CONT'D)
That’s him. Holy shit! It’s him. 
I’m sure of it. This is pure evil. 
Demonic. I can feel the rage 
slamming up against me. 
She shudders, and struggles to breathe.
JAMIE(CONT'D)
Ya’ gotta get him, Marty. He’ll 
never stop. Never.
He leans out the door.
MARTIN
Dugan, Makowsky, get in here!
DUGAN AND MAKOWSKY, two police detectives, appear.
MARTIN(CONT'D)
Jamie’s I.D.’d the son of a bitch.  
This is it. 25 Old River Creek 
Road. Move out!
Martin straps on his holster. He kisses Jamie on the 
forehead, before he and the two men rush out.
INT./EXT. LAPD HEADQUARTERS - MAIN HALL - DAY
Martin rushes past the policewoman.
MARTIN
Get me four units back-up at 25 Old 
River Creek Rd. STAT.
He and the detectives run out to their cars and drive away.
Jamie carefully places the black king and the sharp plastic 
knife back in the bag. She moves to Martin’s chair, staring 
glumly at the computer. The photo of Willy Hynes, a vicious 
serial killer, morphs into the man’s live face, staring back 
at her, menacingly.7."
"8.EXT. NEW ZEALAND - TROPICAL BEACH - DAY/NIGHT
Fog obscures the SURF’S UP snack bar above the beach. Whales 
are strewn on the sand like gigantic boulders the tide has 
tossed aside, before retreating to the deep. 
VOLUNTEERS work frantically, but it’s hopeless.
Luminous against the haze and cold shiver of death, Jamie 
sits up close to a pregnant whale, lovingly stroking her 
dying body. 
A tear wells up in the whale’s eye and falls to the sand. A 
last belabored breath from her blowhole - mother and unborn 
die.
Night falls. Volunteers have all left. The beach is a morgue 
of giants. Only Jamie stays for that final death, the last 
breath. Silent tears stream down her cheeks.
ABOVE, DENSE LOW CLOUDS FORM A STRANGE AND UNNATURAL GRID. 
CRACKLING, SIZZLING SOUNDS PULSE TO A STEADY RHYTHM. 
INT. RESORT HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY 
There’s a painted MAORI WAR DANCER doing the Haka for a few 
pasty-white TOURISTS - new arrivals - off to a corner of the 
open-air lobby. There’s a sign BEACH CLOSED on the path that 
leads down to the ill-fated beach, which is veiled in a smear 
of dense fog. 
Ceiling fans do nothing to move the heavy, sticky heat.
Like a ghostly apparition, Jamie steps out of the fog into 
the lobby. Her eyes are puffy and bloodshot; her hair’s a 
tangled mop of beach hair and she wears the tortured presence 
of her broken spirit on her skin.  
She walks past a few morose-looking GUESTS, seated in the 
lobby, to reception. The FRONT DESK CLERK hands her the room 
key, but no one speaks. No one smiles.
Covered in beach tar and sand, she walks the path to her 
bungalow, and closes herself inside.
INT. RESORT HOTEL - JAMIE’S BUNGALOW - DAY
She falls onto the bed, exhausted, her grimy feet dangling 
over the edge. The cell phone buzzes and vibrates on the 
night stand. 
JAMIE
Go away.
The phone sounds an incoming SMS. She grabs it and reads the 
message. 8."
"9.JAMIE(CONT'D)
Damn you, oil man.
She turns off the phone and trudges into the bathroom, 
struggling to get her fingers through the dread locks that 
have formed in her hair.
We hear the SHOWER RUNNING. 
INT. AMANDA’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY (PRESENT)
Amanda’s kitchen window hints at a glimpse of the Golden Gate 
Bridge, but it’s shrouded in fog and pounding rain.
Her hair streaked with gray, Amanda still cuts a striking 
figure. She could easily be mistaken for Jamie’s sister.
She whips up some eggs. Jamie sits at the dining table, 
facing her, sipping coffee. In flannel pajamas, she looks 
like a wounded child.
AMANDA
I long to see the light back in 
those beautiful blues. 
JAMIE
I’ll be okay. Sooner or later, this 
has to pass. Grief needs time. Only 
time can heal it.
Amanda pours the eggs into the pan and places her arms around 
Jamie’s shoulders from behind. 
AMANDA
You did what you could on that 
beach. You know that.
Jamie looks lost and distant.
JAMIE
I felt like I was swimming into 
that eye. So deep. 
Amanda kisses Jamie’s hair, and returns to the stove. 
JAMIE(CONT'D)
Our souls fused.
Amanda serves up an omelette. Just as she sits down at the 
table, Jamie’s phone rings. 
JAMIE(CONT'D)
This oil guy again. He is a 
persistent pain in the ass! I could 
kill Marty for giving him my 
number.9."
"10.AMANDA
Talk to him, honey. You know what 
they say about the devil you know.
Begrudgingly, Jamie answers.
JAMIE
(into phone)
Mr. Anderson, please lose my 
number. I’m permanently 
unavailable. No, I’m sorry, I’m not 
interested. Absolutely not.
She covers the mouthpiece.
JAMIE(CONT'D)
He’s in town.
AMANDA
(whispering)
Hear him out!
Jamie sighs, looking woefully at her mother.
JAMIE
(into phone)
I suppose. Okay, the Saint Francis, 
fine. 7:30. I’ll ring you from the 
lobby.
She hangs up. 
JAMIE(CONT'D)
Why can’t I ever say no and mean 
it?
AMANDA
It’s the devil that you know, baby. 
Trust me. Been there.
INT. ST. FRANCIS HOTEL - LOBBY - NIGHT
Jamie’s entrance into the hotel lobby is like a breath of 
fresh air in a lifeless vacuum of pretentious brocade and 
heavy velvet. 
MAT ANDERSON (68), Napoleon in cowboy boots, is at the front 
desk, his back to her. 
JAMIE
Mat Anderson?
He turns to face her, visibly taken aback. 
MAT ANDERSON
Well now, how about that? Wow. 
That’s impressive.10."
"11.Jamie towers over him. She reaches out to shake hands. 
JAMIE
The boots kind of give you away.
Mat laughs.
MAT ANDERSON
Yeah, I suppose it’s not too 
terribly cosmopolitan of me...
He reaches out and they shake hands.
MAT ANDERSON(CONT'D)
I do thank you for meeting with me. 
I appreciate it. I truly do.
JAMIE
You weren’t going to give up if I 
didn’t.
MAT ANDERSON
Giving up is for losers, ma’am.
He smiles slyly and gestures in the direction of the 
restaurant.
MAT ANDERSON(CONT'D)
Shall we?
INT. ST. FRANCIS HOTEL - RESTAURANT - NIGHT
The MAITRE D’ escorts them to a private corner table. He 
returns with a bottle of Cristal, pours, sets the bottle in 
the ice bucket, and walks away, discretely. Mat raises his 
glass.
MAT ANDERSON
You are quite the phenomenon, Miss 
Jamie. Beautiful, too. Can’t help 
but notice that.
Jamie takes a sip and sets her glass back down, guardedly 
scrutinizing his every move, every word.
JAMIE
I would prefer that we dispense 
with flattery. 
Mat looks taken aback.
MAT ANDERSON
We can do that. But let me at least 
say that I was downright bowled 
over by what I found when I was, 
shall we say, “investigating” you.11."
"12.JAMIE
And to what do I owe the honor of 
being “investigated” by the CEO of 
USOIL?
MAT ANDERSON
Well, now, you found two wells for 
the A-rabs in two months. Why, that 
makes you a person of interest - 
and an extremely valuable 
commodity. 
JAMIE
They were Pakistanis. How do you 
know about that?
MAT ANDERSON
There’s plenty of buzz about it in 
my circles. You’re lucky they let 
you get away, to be honest.
JAMIE
So you’ve come here to try to 
convince me to be an “extremely 
valuable commodity” for you, is 
that right? 
MAT ANDERSON 
Am I that obvious?
Jamie nods.
MAT ANDERSON(CONT'D)
USOIL’s scouring the Pacific Ocean, 
out there off California - all the 
way up to Vancouver - but we keep 
coming up dry. I’m just about plum 
out of ideas. Tell the truth, 
ma’am, we’re floating around out 
there, blind.
JAMIE
I get pretty nervous thinking about 
an oil research vessel “blindly,” 
scraping the ocean floor.
MAT ANDERSON
Yeah, well, I’m so aware of the 
ecological implications of our work 
out there. Don’t you worry about 
that. I’m in no mood for another 
disaster, especially one with our 
name on it. 
JAMIE
Not to mention what it would mean 
for the health of the ocean.12."
"13.He leans back in his chair, studying her.
MAT ANDERSON
Here’s the thing. I have a five-
year agreement with the U.S. and 
Canadian governments. Call it an 
iron-clad contract. I get things 
done right, nobody else comes in. 
But I need more than technology - I 
got the best of the best. I need 
your vision.
JAMIE
Within days, my foundation will be 
in place. Big Oil and government - 
the military - are what I'm 
fighting against. And, no offense, 
but I just don’t trust you.
He stares down into the champagne flute, strategizing, 
sipping slowly. 
MAT ANDERSON
I’m going to do my best to win you 
over. 
The Maitre D’ places the menus on the table. Mat signals him 
that they’re not ready to order.
MAT ANDERSON(CONT'D)
No disrespect, but you don’t really 
think you can win against the oil 
industry, now do you, Miss Jamie? I 
mean, don’t get me wrong. It’s very 
honorable of you for tryin’. It’s a 
feel good thing. I get that. As for 
the military, why ... let’s say 
we’re just one big happy family. 
You can trust me on that.
Jamie bristles.
MAT ANDERSON(CONT'D)
Y'all are going to need funding, 
though. You see, we could help 
there.
JAMIE
Funding from the enemy - an oil 
company? 
MAT ANDERSON
An ecologically friendly oil 
company. USOIL is that company. We 
may make mistakes, but hell, we’re 
no enemy to the whales and sea 
life. 13."
"(MORE)14.JAMIE
Right.
MAT ANDERSON
The way I see it, you’re gonna need 
connections: you know - decision 
makers. I like to think of them as 
friends in high places. What you’re 
gonna need, Miss Jamie, is my kind 
of friends.
JAMIE
Look, Mr. Anderson...
MAT ANDERSON
Mat.
JAMIE
...for starters, I’m done with oil, 
period. 
MAT ANDERSON
You can name your price. I’m sure 
we can top anything you’ve been 
paid by the A-rabs.
JAMIE
Money is not the point. And how 
dare you?
MAT ANDERSON
Money is always the point. 
Jamie stands to leave.
JAMIE
I think we’re done here.
He grabs her arm.
MAT ANDERSON
Now, hold on a minute. Don’t be 
getting all riled up - no offense 
meant. I’m just a corporate guy is 
all.
She sits back down, hesitantly.
MAT ANDERSON(CONT'D)
Hear me out. My ship goes back out 
in a few weeks. I need you on it. 
Use your powers to pinpoint the 
coordinates we need and I’ll use 
mine to get you one hell of a lot 
of support for your non-profit. 
It’s not just money - it’s power. I 
can deliver that ... in spades. 
(MORE)14."
"MAT ANDERSON (CONT'D)15.I’ll get you lobby power in D.C., 
and we'll see what we can do to get 
the military to ease up on them big 
ol' whales, too. That is what 
you’re gonna need if you want to 
make any progress out there.
Jamie scrutinizes Mat, sipping from her glass.
JAMIE
You’re asking me to help you 
destroy the ecosystem. 
MAT ANDERSON
I am definitely not. Quite the 
opposite. What I’m asking is for 
you to help me prevent any more 
cock-ups out there, and to tell us 
where to drill. Nice and clean. 
Look, if I’m turning to a psychic, 
it’s because I’m an out-of-the-box 
kind of thinker - you’ll give me 
that, won’t you? My people think 
I’m crazy ... but I don’t have to 
understand how you do what you do. 
I just know you’ve got an 
undeniable track record. Absolutely 
freaking undeniable. All you need 
to do is locate a pocket. Tell us 
what you see down there and we go 
in: no mess, no tearing up the 
Pacific. I just know you don’t want 
that either. 
He leans in closer.
MAT ANDERSON(CONT'D)
Say yes. For the whales.
JAMIE
That’s not a decision I can make 
over a glass of champagne.
MAT ANDERSON
Why now, Miss Jamie, are you about 
to make me an indecent proposal?
Jamie tries not to smile.
JAMIE
Most definitely not, Mr. Mat.
He hands her a menu.
MAT ANDERSON
Shall we order? I have worked me up 
one ferocious appetite.MAT ANDERSON (CONT'D)15."
"16.INT. USOIL - BOARDROOM - DAY 
TWELVE EXECUTIVES sit nervously around a boardroom table. On 
the wall behind the head chair is a large oceanographic 
chart, marked: PACIFIC NORTHWEST.
MAT ANDERSON storms in, carrying a stack of reports. He’s a 
stressed-out, red-faced volcano waiting to blow. 
MAT ANDERSON
As y’all can imagine, this is not a 
good news get together.
He takes his seat, pulling a laser pen, glasses case, and two 
cell phones from his pocket, and placing them squarely in 
front of him.
MAT ANDERSON(CONT'D)
Nope, this is bad news, I’m afraid. 
More bad news. So let me cut right 
to the chase. We’re in deep shit, 
here, gentlemen. We lost our asses 
in the Gulf and we won’t even talk 
about the BP disaster. The Gulf is 
dead. Finito.
(clearing his throat)
We’re racing around the Pacific 
over two years now and we have got 
shit to show for it. Shit with a 
capital S.
He pulls a near-empty packet of Rolaids from his pocket and 
pops one into his mouth.
MAT ANDERSON(CONT'D)
I’ve got these clowns on the Hill 
with their greasy palms all over my 
behind and all I can say to these 
kind gentlemen is “we’re getting 
close.” Imagine?
The executives dart glances at each other, avoiding eye 
contact with him. He loosens his tie, sweating, tight-jawed.
MAT ANDERSON(CONT'D)
It’s coming at me from all sides. 
Corporate screaming blue zonkers, 
lobbyists, environmentalists ... 
and all these do-gooders making 
waves about the goddamn whales... 
He walks to the coffee service table and pours himself a cup. 
MAT ANDERSON(CONT'D)

blasting their big ol’ brains out. 16."

INT. EXECUTIVE FLOOR LOBBY - DAY
Mat’s twenty-two-year-old trophy secretary, LOUISE, files a 
nail at her desk. It’s polished pearl pink to match her 
clingy cashmere dress. Not a strand of lacquered blonde hair 
is out of place. She answers the phone.
LOUISE

She hangs up and adjusts her make-up. 
The antithesis of Miss Texas, Jamie steps out of the elevator 
- fresh, unpretentious beauty. Louise escorts her to the

Mat clears his throat, nervously.
MAT ANDERSON
Yes, absolutely, if I can get back 
to you a bit later in the day? Full 
slate through lunch.
Mat hangs up and walks back over to his chair, clearing his 
throat, nervously. He stares at the phone where he reads: 
FORTY-EIGHT HOURS, SHIP OUT. He sets down the phone, 
unsettled.
MAT ANDERSON(CONT'D)
My apologies. Now where was I? 
About this Jamie Hastings. The 
woman worked for LAPD for five 
years. Put away fifty-three child 
rapers and murderers. Five-three. 
Imagine? She goes on CNN and Bam! 
The next thing you know some OPEC 
guy is flying her ass out to 
Lahore. She gets “visions” or 
whatever and the crude starts 
gushing. That’s what I know. That’s 
all I need to know.
He slams the report down on the table.
MAT ANDERSON(CONT'D)
Two sites in two months, yet we 
industry giants - the experts, mind 
you - haven’t found a fucking drop 
of crude in two years? Do y’all see 
the irony in that? MAT ANDERSON (CONT'D)
(MORE)18."
"MAT ANDERSON (CONT'D)19.Well, boys, Jamie Hastings is 
outside that door. We got ourselves 
our own first-class psychic. It 
took some major persuasion, I 
assure you - but she’s willing to 
help us out, before we tear up the 
whole goddamn ocean floor, like 
some crazy-ass gophers chewing up 
the golf green.
He buzzes the intercom and speaks into the speaker.
MAT ANDERSON(CONT'D)
Go ahead and show Miss Hastings in.
He stands, buttons his jacket, and greets Jamie at the door. 
He motions for her to enter. The men stand, looking 
bewildered.
MAT ANDERSON(CONT'D)
It’s my pleasure to introduce Miss 
Jamie Hastings. I know y’all join 
me in welcoming her to the team.
JAMIE
Gentlemen.
The execs nod stiffly. Mat shows her to the empty chair next 
to him. They all take their seats.
MAT ANDERSON
I‘ve already filled you in on Miss 
Hastings’ remarkable feats and 
unparalleled track record.
Jamie is comfortable in her skin. She’s gracious, but focused 
on Mat, ignoring the men. He points the laser pen on the map, 
to where ORCA SANCTUARY is handwritten in pencil.
MAT ANDERSON(CONT'D)
We have carte blanche from the 
Canadians to open up this new area. 
Jamie stares at the map.
JAMIE
What about that Orca sanctuary?
Mat looks around the room, at the men.
MAT ANDERSON
Why, yes, there are a few stretches 
where the whales seem to want the 
right of way, but it’s not a 
problem.
JAMIE
Sorry, how is it “not a problem?”MAT ANDERSON (CONT'D)19."
"(MORE)20.MAT ANDERSON
Well, I mean we navigate around it - 
that’s why it’s marked off. It’s 
just an indication of where we see 
a lot of Orca’s moving through is 
all.
JAMIE
I thought we were more than clear 
about the whales.
MAT ANDERSON
That’s right. You have my assurance 
that we’ll do our best to avoid any 
collateral damage.
JAMIE
Collateral damage? Where have we 
heard that before? 
MAT ANDERSON
You have my word on that. 
JAMIE
And I’m supposed to trust you, with 
an Orca sanctuary right in the 
middle of your trajectory?
MAT ANDERSON
(tight-lipped)
I just said you have my word. 
Houston’s worst sexist, JEB RICHARDSON, leans over to the man 
sitting next to him. 
JEB
(in a low voice)
I always say a woman should be 
obscene and not heard.
MAT ANDERSON
I say we continue this over vodka 
marties and then adjourn for lunch. 
Lighten things up a little. If you 
gentlemen will accompany Miss 
Hastings to the dining room? I’ll 
be right behind.
The group escorts her out. She peers curiously over her 
shoulder at Mat, as the last of the men closes the door. 
Mat speed dials number 2, and holds the phone tightly up 
close to his lips.
MAT ANDERSON(CONT'D)
Hey, Jimmy. There’s been a change 
in plans. Be ready to sail in forty-
eight hours. 
(MORE)20."
"MAT ANDERSON (CONT'D)21.We’ve got the Hastings woman. I 
promised you’ll keep a low profile 
with the whales. And tell that hot 
shot Sam to be cool or I’ll yank 
his ass, daddy or no daddy.
INT. EXECUTIVE DINING ROOM - DAY
Mat enters the lunchroom, where the men and Jamie are seated 
around a dining room table. They’re engrossed in Jamie’s 
storytelling. 
JAMIE
...that’s when they nailed him.
Jeb’s arms and legs are tightly crossed.
JEB
You’re trying to tell us you solved 
the Willie Hynes case? Just little 
ol’ you - up against the police 
power of four states?
JAMIE
I never said that. It was a team 
effort.
JEB
And how did that work? Did you just 
conjure up his face, while he was 
slashing up those little girls?
Jamie ignores him and continues to speak to the other men.
JAMIE
Hynes always left behind a 
signature - a chess piece. Serial 
killers usually do. When they 
handed me the piece from the last 
murder - the black king - with the 
murder weapon, I was finally able 
to see him. I’m sure you saw the 
pictures of that tattoo: BLACK 
KING. They were all over the news.
JEB
You can't seriously be telling us 
that all you had to do was hold a 
couple of pieces of plastic in your 
hands and poof! Seventeen murders 
were miraculously solved.
JAMIE
I’m DEAD serious.
The waiter sets down a tray of hors d’oeuvres and walks out.MAT ANDERSON (CONT'D)21."
"22.JEB
So, the next thing we know, y'all 
are gonna start reading everybody's 
palm or something, is that right?
JAMIE
I'm not a fortune teller.
JEB
You mean you're not going to read 
my horoscope?
Jamie and Jeb reach for an hors d’oeuvre in the same moment. 
The back of his hand brushes up against hers. Jamie sits bold 
upright in her chair, rigid. Ghostly white.
JAMIE
Billy’s here.
Jeb’s face goes red. He leaps from his chair, enraged.
JEB
(to Mat)
What the hell kind of game is this?
(to Jamie)
How do you know about my Billy?
The men sit frozen in a paranormal chill.
JEB(CONT'D)
My boy is dead and buried. Don’t 
you try to play with my head, 
Missy.
JAMIE
He's here. Billy’s here. I need 
your help to bring him through.
Angry and confused, Jeb sits back down. Jamie’s eyes are 
closed.
JAMIE(CONT'D)
It’s about the accident. He’s 
begging you to stop beating 
yourself up. He says he can't bear 
to see you’re still in the dark.
Jamie’s posture changes. She shrinks down into the chair, 
transformed, child-like.
JAMIE(CONT'D)
(in a child’s voice)
Forgive yourself, Daddy-o. I'm 
here. Always. You just can't see 
me, but I always see you. I love 
you, Champ.22."
"23.Jeb lowers his face into his hands and sobs. Everybody is 
stunned. Mat is white as a sheet.
Instinctively, Jamie goes to Jeb and cradles him in her 
embrace. He reaches into his wallet and extracts a photo, 
which he holds up to Jamie, his hand shaking. On it is 
written: YOU’RE MY CHAMP, DADDY-O. I LOVE YOU, BILLY.
EXT. VANCOUVER - HARBOR - PIER - DAY
An imposing three-hundred-foot super yacht is birthed off a 
private pier. There’s a labyrinth of radar equipment, a 
helicopter landing pad at the back, and the ship’s own twenty-
foot submarine. At the stern, the name, THE DEEPWATER, 
glistens in gold.
The DRIVER opens the door for Jamie. She steps out and stares 
at the grandiose ship.
SAM KEMMERIES, a preppy blonde Adonis, saunters up the walk, 
accompanied by LIZ BARTHOLOMEW, a knock-out, Eurasian beauty: 
human Ken and Barbie dolls. 
SAM
I’m Sam, Chief Technician, and Liz, 
here, is our new intern.
Jamie pushes her sunglasses back over her head and stares 
them both in the eyes, before shaking hands. 
A strange shadow passes over Liz’s face. Jamie looks up to 
see a cloud has covered the sun, in an otherwise perfectly 
blue sky.
The driver retrieves the luggage and places it near Sam.
SAM(CONT'D)
Take those down to the ship.
Glaring at Sam, the driver walks ahead, carrying Jamie’s bags 
over the ramp, and sets them on deck.
JAMIE
That’s some research vessel.
They approach the ship’s ramp. Jamie fixates on the complex 
radar equipment. Sam walks ahead. 
EXT. VANCOUVER - SHIP IN HARBOR - MAIN DECK - DAY
They walk across the main deck to a doorway.23."
"24.INT. MAIN HALLWAY - DAY
Liz’s cell phone rings. She disappears, with the phone to her 
ear, through a doorway off the hall. Sam walks Jamie straight 
to her stateroom.
INT. JAMIE’S STATEROOM - DAY
Light from three porthole windows illuminates the room. 
There’s a bouquet of flowers on a coffee table. She reads the 
card: WELCOME TO THE DREAM TEAM, MAT. She smiles and slips it 
back into the bouquet. 
Sam loiters behind, rapping his fingers against the door 
jamb.
SAM
We’ll get your bags down later.
JAMIE
How about sooner?
SAM
I’m not sure who’s around now. 
JAMIE
Where can I find the Captain?
SAM
Last time I saw him he was up at 
the Crow’s Nest on the pier.
JAMIE
Okay, well. Maybe you can send 
someone to let him know I’ve 
boarded. 
SAM
He knows.
He turns his back to Jamie and walks down the hall. Jamie 
closes the door behind him. She falls on the bed, kicks off 
her shoes and closes her eyes, massaging her temples.
There’s a KNOCK at the door. Liz walks right in, dragging 
Jamie’s bag. She pulls the case into the room.
LIZ
(posh British accent)
Don’t mind Sam. His father’s a 
Senator, so he’s got a bit of an 
attitude.
Jamie sits up at the edge of the bed.
JAMIE
“A bit.”24."
"25.LIZ
But he really is a sweetie, once 
you get to know him.
JAMIE
I guess I have that to look forward 
to. 
LIZ
Anyway ... coffee and your other 
case are on the way.
BOBBY, the youngest member of the crew, appears in a Grateful 
Dead T-shirt, jeans and baseball cap; he’s got a tray with 
coffee in one hand, and he’s dragging her case with the 
other. He parks the case at the doorway and places the tray 
on the entry table.
BOBBY
Welcome aboard. I’m Bobby. You 
could say I’m the ship’s Jack-of-
all-trades.
Jamie reaches out and they shake hands.
BOBBY(CONT'D)
The rest of the crew comes in the 
morning. Anything you need now, let 
me know. 
JAMIE
Thanks. I’m just hoping to meet the 
Captain for now.
BOBBY
He’ll be here.
Bobby leaves. Liz carries the tray to the coffee table. Jamie 
pulls a fancy cookie tin out of her carry-on bag and they sit 
down on the sofa.
JAMIE
Amanda’s cosmic cookies. 
She opens the tin and extends it to Liz, who puts her face up 
close and breathes in deeply, before reaching for one.
LIZ
“I shouldn’t,” says she.
JAMIE
A little sin now and then... 
Liz takes a cookie and nibbles on it, gingerly.
LIZ
Mmm. Heavenly.25."
"26.She pours Jamie a cup of coffee.
LIZ (CONT'D)
My mum’s psychic - nothing like 
you, I imagine. But she can read my 
mind sometimes, I swear. Me, I take 
after my father. He’s an 
aeronautics engineer. I inherited 
his scientific mind. 
JAMIE
He’s in the British military?
LIZ
(evasively)
Father? No, not anymore. He still 
consults now and then, last I 
heard. 
After the brief coffee break, Jamie stands up and grabs her 
purse, extracting her luggage keys.
LIZ(CONT'D)
I’ll leave you to get settled in. 
I’ll come back for you when the 
captain arrives.
She walks to the doorway and turns back around.
LIZ(CONT'D)
And thanks for the calories.
INT. JAMIE’S STATEROOM - BEDROOM - DAY
Jamie wheels her suitcase into the bedroom and unpacks. She 
pulls out a crystal skull and places it on the night stand. 
She lies down on the bed, barely able to keep her eyes open. 
MONTAGE: THE WAKE UP CALL
--She sets the alarm for 18:00 and quickly falls asleep.
--Digital display hits 17:59. Her eyes flash open.
--Digital display turns to 18:00 and BUZZES.
--She turns off the alarm and jumps out of bed.
CLOSE UP: AN EERIE WHALE’S EYE INSIDE THE SKULL SEEMS TO 
WATCH HER LEAVE THE ROOM.26."
"27.INT. DINING ROOM/LOUNGE - DAY
Over-the-top in luxury and comfort, the lounge boasts a mega 
TV screen, enough recreational space for a small army, and 
formal dining area. In a corner, there’s a lived-in, 
overstuffed arm chair that doesn’t fit with the modern 
furnishings, an end table and lamp. 
Sam is sprawled out on the sofa, sipping a beer, talking with 
Liz and Bobby. 
SAM
How bad are things in Houston if 
they’re bringing in a fucking 
psychic surveyor. Jesus.
The ship’s medic, DOC (70’s), a gray-haired, bearded man, is 
seated in an armchair across from Bobby. He has the ruddy 
complexion of an Irishman and the wrinkled skin of a man 
who’s spent his life at sea. 
DOC
Open mind. We’ll know soon enough.
SAM
Can’t believe the captain would 
agree to that weird shit. 
DOC
I doubt he has anything to say 
about it.
SAM
That Texas heat must be melting a 
few boardroom brains.
In the background, CAPTAIN JIMBO fills the doorway. He’s a 
big, proud African-American with one ton of attitude for each 
of his sixty-five years. He sports a worn leather hat, faded 
jeans and a waterproof parka. There’s a big shark’s tooth 
dangling from a leather chord around his neck.
We hear the jingle of a dog’s collar. FIN, a male golden 
Labrador retriever, enters right behind him and then sits at 
attention by his side.
JIMBO
I hear our guest has arrived.
LIZ
Yes, she’s settling in.
JIMBO
Well, let’s show her a little 
hospitality, shall we?
LIZ
I’ll go get her.27."
"28.Liz exits and returns with Jamie. She’s carrying a bag on her 
shoulder. Jimbo walks over to her and shakes her hand.
JIMBO
It’s a pleasure to welcome you 
aboard. You’ve met Sam and Liz.
JAMIE
Yes. And Bobby.
JIMBO
And that’s Doc. He’s the ship’s 
medic, when he’s not busy keeping 
Captain J. out of trouble.
Doc peers over his glasses at Jamie and nods. She nods back.
ALBERTO, the ship’s swarthy, good-looking thirty-something 
Italian chef, walks in with a tray of canapés and sets it on 
the table.
JIMBO(CONT'D)
Meet Alberto. God blessed us with 
an Italian chef.
Alberto smiles at her flirtatiously. Jamie avoids eye 
contact.
JIMBO(CONT'D)
We’re missing our second officer, 
Brady ... Mike, the Chief Engineer 
... and Domenico, ship’s steward. 
They come aboard in a bit. 
Sam pops peanuts into his mouth, chased by beer. Jimbo 
gestures to Jamie to take a seat and they both sit down.
FIN goes straight to Jamie. They stare into each others’ 
eyes, and bond instantly.
JIMBO(CONT'D)
Wow! How about that? What can I get 
you Miss Jamie?
JAMIE
Nothing for now, thanks.
He pulls a beer from the refrigerator, twists off the top, 
and sits in the old arm chair. He marvels at how Fin has 
attached himself to Jamie. Throwing his feet on the coffee 
table in front of him, he swigs the beer.
JAMIE(CONT'D)
I guess you’re all wondering what 
I’m doing here. Most people are 
uncomfortable when psychics are 
around, especially in a setting 
like this. I get that. A lot.28."
"29.Sam fiddles with his cell phone, tuned out. He looks up, 
catches Jimbo’s disapproving stare, and stashes the phone 
into his pocket.
JAMIE(CONT'D)
Mat Anderson is convinced I’ve got 
the stuff to pinpoint one or more 
oil pockets, two to three miles 
below the sea. It worked in the 
desert; I’ll try to make it work in 
the ocean. You got the mandate, 
Captain?
Jimbo nods. Jamie makes eye contact with everyone.
JAMIE(CONT'D)
I’ll try to stay out of everybody’s 
way, but I have had carte blanche 
from Mat Anderson - so we need to 
work together. I agreed to do this 
to avoid as much damage as possible 
to the sea floor, while steering 
the ship away from any whale 
migration routes and to protect the 
Orca sanctuary. I made this very 
clear in Houston.
Liz’s cell phone rings again. She walks out.
SAM
(sarcastically)
Problem: whales don’t have strict 
migratory routes. We can’t predict 
when one is going to decide to get 
in the way.
She turns to the others, ignoring him.
JAMIE
Their well-being comes before 
everything else. These are my terms 
and they’re not negotiable.
Jimbo and Sam exchange glances. Jimbo nods. Liz re-enters 
with BRADY (40). He postures like a former marine. 
LIZ
Excuse me. Meet Brady, second 
officer.
Jamie smiles, acknowledging him. Jimbo walks to the bar, and 
sets his beer bottle into a tray.
JIMBO
I expect no less than complete 
cooperation from everyone, and 
total support for our guest.29."
"30.JAMIE
Thank you, Captain.
JIMBO
Okay, people. We’ll have time to 
socialize later. Let’s get this 
Lady ready to roll. Berto, run your 
stock checks. Sam, check the 
equipment. I’m going down below. 
(to Jamie)
If you’ll excuse us?
As he walks out, Fin by his side, he turns to Liz.
JIMBO(CONT'D)
How about you give Miss Jamie the 
Captain’s tour?
LIZ
Sure! 
(to Jamie)
Follow me!
She and Jamie leave together.
EXT. MAIN DECK - DAY (SUNSET)
LIZ
There you have it. One glorious 
ship. Breathtaking, isn’t she?
JAMIE
She is that. 
LIZ
Lucky us, right?
Jamie walks to the railing and looks out, uneasy, across the 
water.
JAMIE
Yeah. “Lucky.”
LIZ
I’ve got to run up to tech a 
minute. Will you be okay out here? 
Jamie nods, her gaze combing the sea. Sunset, melting orange 
sherbet over the horizon, yields to night.
LIZ(CONT'D)
Dinner’s at eight.
Liz disappears through the door, into the ship’s interior.30."
"31.INT. GALLEY - NIGHT
Alberto bangs around in the galley, double-checking food 
stocks and other provisions, preparing the evening meal.
INT. TECH ROOM - NIGHT
Sam and Liz are seated in front of a gigantic wall of 
electronic equipment, reading monitors, running tests.
INT. ENGINE ROOM - NIGHT
Captain Jimbo and MIKE (40), a stocky guy with grease under 
his fingernails, inspect the engines.
INT. DINING ROOM/LOUNGE - NIGHT
Fin curls up near Jimbo’s armchair. Suddenly alert, his ears 
move back and forth like antennae. He pushes the door to main 
deck and runs out.
EXT. MAIN DECK - NIGHT 
Jamie stares pensively at the water. Fin, perched up against 
the railing next to her, searches sounds we can’t hear. 
They’re both transfixed.
INT. DINING ROOM/LOUNGE - NIGHT
The table groans with food: steamed and spicy jumbo shrimp, 
fried calamari and french fries, strewn on family-style 
platters. Jamie and Fin enter. Jimbo motions for her to take 
the seat at the opposite head of the table. The staff take 
their seats.
The staff serve themselves once Jimbo has filled his plate. 
Fin looks up reassuringly at Jamie, but goes to his master, 
eyeballing Jimbo’s dinner.
JIMBO
Hot damn! This is out of sight. 
Takes me right back to New Orleans. 
Those were some happy days, my 
friends. Hoo Lordy! Crazy, happy 
days.
He peels a shrimp for Fin, and then eats heartily, belting 
back the beer. 
Alberto takes the seat next to Jamie. He sees her plate is 
empty - just a few fries. He inadvertently catches Jimbo’s 
glance.31."
"32.JIMBO(CONT'D)
Well, now, what’s up with that, 
Miss Jamie? Don’t tell me you’re a 
vegetarian.
She nods.
JAMIE
I always manage, don’t worry about 
it.
JIMBO
(to Alberto)
Did we not get the memo?
ALBERTO
Afraid not. I’ll get Dom to load up 
at the market in the morning.
JIMBO
That’s a damn shame! You do not 
know what you’re missing.
JAMIE
I don’t eat anything with eyes.
JIMBO
Is that right? Well, hell! We got 
anything without eyes in the 
larder, Berto?
ALBERTO
Can do.
Alberto disappears into the galley. He returns with a mixed 
salad for Jamie. Jimbo peels a couple of shrimp and feeds 
them to Fin, alert - but never begging.
JIMBO
Ya’ hear that, boy? “No eyes.”
First to finish, Jimbo disappears into the galley. He 
returns, drying his hands with paper towels. He takes another 
beer from the refrigerator and falls into his armchair, 
patting his stomach.
JIMBO(CONT'D)
I have got to learn some self- 
control.
One by one, they push away from the table, stuffed, and 
adjourn to the lounge. 
JIMBO(CONT'D)
Don’t be shy, Miss Jamie. We don’t 
bite, do we, boy?32."
"33.Jamie joins him in the lounge. He reaches for a cigar case 
and retrieves a cigar and cutter. He cuts the tip, and 
prepares for a smoke. 
JIMBO(CONT'D)
Needless-to-say, you don’t smoke.
JAMIE
Depends on the occasion.
She reaches into her bag, from which she extracts a box of 
exclusive Cuban cigars, and places it on the coffee table.
JAMIE(CONT'D)
But I only smoke COHIBAS.
Jimbo stares at the box of expensive, rare cigars, visibly 
taken aback. He looks up at Jamie, with a Cheshire cat grin.
JIMBO
A cigar-smoking vegetarian from San 
Francisco? Well, now, if that ain’t 
one hell of a contradiction!
He runs his fingers over the name on the box with reverence.
JIMBO(CONT'D)
Cohibas. A whole box full. Now how 
in the hell could you have known?
He puts the cigar back in case, picks up box. He breathes it 
in, from corner to corner, smiling up at Jamie.
JAMIE
They don’t call me psychic for 
nothing, Captain.
JIMBO
Jimbo. Friends call me Jimbo.
Delicately, he peels the protective wrapping, cuts the seal, 
and opens the box, like a kid at Christmas. He takes out two 
cigars, closes the box, and performs the tip-cutting ritual.
JAMIE
Shouldn’t we go outside?
JIMBO
With a full box of Cohibas inside? 
No ma’am.
He lights Jamie’s cigar, then his. His eyes shine, reflecting 
the flame. He breaths in the mythical Cohiba with gusto. 
JIMBO(CONT'D)
Oh ... yeah.33."
"34.Clenching the cigar between his teeth, he pulls a bottle of 
vintage scotch and two glasses from a cabinet marked 
CAPTAIN’S STASH, and pours them both a drink. Jamie sips the 
scotch and puffs lightly on the cigar. 
JIMBO(CONT'D)
I sure didn’t give you a proper 
welcome, I can admit that. I had 
you figured for some know-it-all, 
off-the-wall woo woo mama. 
Jamie smiles, looking him deep in the eyes.
JAMIE
“Woo woo mama?” That’s a new one. 
“Off the wall” I’ve always been. 
What good are walls, anyway, right?
Jimbo smiles, intrigued. He downs his drink and pours 
another. Doc is seated across the room, with one eye on the 
TV, and the other on Jimbo.
JIMBO
(slurring)
Been on ships since I was a half-
assed, stupid punk, just old enough 
to enlist. Shipped out to ‘Nam 
quick. I met Mat in that hell hole. 
He taught me all I know about 
ships. Saved my life once or twice 
too.
He taps the ash into the ashtray.
JIMBO(CONT'D)
Got me some trophies along the way 
and a lot of trouble. How about 
that big mutha white shark, eh, 
Doc? He’s out there swimmin’ around 
one fine sunny day. The water was 
like glass. Hell, I see this giant 
fin moving in on him. I’m 
screamin’, “shark!” but he’s 
upwind, so I grab the spear gun and 
I shoot that white belly jaws ass 
dead. 
He slaps his knee, the cigar clenched between his teeth.
JIMBO(CONT'D)
See, Doc, he almost died of a heart 
attack when he saw all that shark 
blood oozin’ through the water. 
Thought it was his own leg or 
something - ain’t that right, Doc?
Doc nods, unamused, while Jimbo recounts the story, laughing.34."
"35.JIMBO(CONT'D)
You should’ve seen him tear ass 
back to the ship - I never seen 
nobody swim like that in my life. 
More of them big muthuh whites 
moving in - tasting blood in the 
water. Still don’t know how we 
pulled him out in time. Sheer 
miracle, I’ll tell ya’ that.
He stops laughing abruptly. 
JIMBO(CONT'D)
Doc never went back in after that. 
Not one time. No sir.
Fin runs to the door and back. He goes to Jimbo then to 
Jamie, to the door again, looking back at them. Jamie puts 
out her half-smoked cigar and follows him out. Jimbo tucks it 
into his cigar case.
EXT. MAIN DECK - NIGHT
Fin rushes to the railing. On hind legs, he stares out, 
whimpering. Dolphins leap in and out of the waves. They 
chatter ... he barks back. He heads for the ship’s ramp.
JIMBO (O.S.)
Fin! Get your ass back in here!
Fin stops in his tracks. His tail low to the ground, he 
returns to Jamie’s side. In the background, dolphins spy-hop 
in the waves, calling him back.
INT. DINING ROOM/LOUNGE - NIGHT
Jamie walks Fin into the lounge. He goes straight to Jimbo, 
who roughs him up, affectionately.
JIMBO
You keep an eye on this lady - and 
leave those damned dolphins alone.
Doc gets up and turns off the table lamp next to Jimbo’s 
armchair. 
DOC
I’d say it’s time to turn in. We’ve 
got a full day ahead of us.
Jamie walks behind Jimbo’s armchair. She leans over and puts 
her arms around his shoulders.
JAMIE
Thank you for letting me in.35."
"36.She kisses his head, picks up her bag and leaves. 
Jimbo caresses the spot.
JIMBO
She’s all right, this Jamie 
Hastings. Sure not hard to look at, 
neither.
Puffing on his cigar, he reaches for the bottle. Doc grabs 
it, and places it on a high shelf, beyond Jimbo’s reach. He 
puts Jimbo’s cigar out in the ashtray.
DOC
Okay Jimmy, that’s it for tonight. 
Come on. I’ll walk you home.
Jimbo staggers when he tries to stand up. Doc holds his arm.  
JIMBO
Just like ol’ times, eh, Doc?
DOC
Yep. Just like’m, Jimbo.
EXT. SHIP AT SEA - DAY 
The ocean is calm; the water refracts light like diamonds. 
Golden rays dance through soft waves. It’s a gentle wind.

Jamie sits on a deck chair, wearing sunglasses and a beach 
hat, wrapped up in a sweater. Sam and Mike engage in 
conversation, out of earshot, at the equipment hold. 
Liz steps out in a skimpy bikini, a diaphanous leopard print 
scarf tied over her slim hips, looking like she walked off 
the cover of SPORTS ILLUSTRATED. She parades around, before 
taking a wet suit from the gear locker. 
LIZ
(to Sam)
Can you help me slip into this?
SAM
It’s a damn shame, covering all 
that up in rubber.
Liz ties her hair in a ponytail, posing, seductive.
Sam’s eyes are glued on her struggling into the wet suit. She 
stretches it past her hips, motioning for him to zip her up 
at the back. The sexual tension sizzles.
Jamie turns her chair to face the railing.36."
"37.LIZ
Jamie. I didn’t see you there! 
Jamie waves from her chair, her back to Liz.
LIZ(CONT'D)
How about that water? Would you 
like to join us?
Sam cringes. 
JAMIE
No thanks. I’m hung over and my 
lungs may actually be collapsing.
Looking relieved, Sam dons his wet suit, and the two of them 
disappear down the stairwell. Carrying a thermos and two 
mugs, Jimbo comes to join Jamie, with Fin.
JIMBO
I hear I got a little out of my 
head last night.
He sets thermos and mugs down on a small table and takes a 
deep breath of sea air, triggering a phlegmatic coughing fit.
JIMBO(CONT'D)
Rumor has it we both missed 
breakfast.
She removes her glasses and looks up at him.
JIMBO(CONT'D)
We wouldn’t want people to get the 
wrong idea.
Fin stretches out between their chairs. Jimbo pours two cups 
and hands one to Jamie. She sips the coffee and grimaces, 
playfully.
JAMIE
This is the worst coffee I have 
ever tasted in my life!
He winks.
JIMBO
Made it myself!
In the background, we hear the VROOM! of a pontoon boat. Mike 
pilots for Sam and Liz, a short distance away from the ship. 
They prepare to dive. Jimbo shakes his head.
JIMBO(CONT'D)
There’s so much that can go wrong 
out here. The sea’s a wild, untamed 
rhapsody when it plays the dark 
keys. 37."
"38.Fin whines woefully.
JIMBO(CONT'D)
Whatch’ya want boy? Your friends 
back?
Fin jumps up eagerly on Jimbo, panting and runs to the 
railing.
JAMIE
You mean to tell me he goes out in 
open ocean with your divers?
JIMBO
No ma’am. He goes out when the 
dolphins come. 
Fin barks vehemently.
JIMBO(CONT'D)
When they come calling, he just has 
to go. I can’t explain it.
JAMIE
Get out!
Fin insists, whining and nudging Jimbo out of his chair.
JIMBO
All right, all right. You just stay 
close now, you hear? Come on.
Jamie stands and grabs her camera. They walk Fin to the 
stairwell and down to lower deck. 
EXT. LOWER DECK - DAY
Jimbo opens a hatch. Fin jumps - almost disappearing in the 
gentle waves. He swims out to where two dolphins have 
surfaced. They leap over and around him.
JAMIE
That’s wild. But aren’t you afraid? 
It’s so dangerous. 
JIMBO
Yep.
Jimbo’s eyes are fixed on Fin.
JIMBO(CONT'D)
Ever since he wandered into my 
life, seems like he’s been trying 
to leave.
Jamie and Jimbo lean against the railing, watching Fin manage 
swimming in deep ocean waves with wild dolphins.38."
"39.JIMBO(CONT'D)
Must have been a dolphin in a 
former life.
JAMIE
“Former life?” Did you really just 
say that? 
JIMBO
I had a girlfriend, Ling, back in 
‘Nam. She was a Buddhist. Taught me 
a lot. But I guess you know all 
there is to know about 
reincarnation.
Jamie holds the camera on Fin, avoiding Jimbo’s eyes. 
JAMIE
Nobody knows all there is to know 
about anything.
Two dolphins leap, slapping their flukes on the waves, 
scaring Fin, who looks confused and unsure. Two more appear. 
Fin looks back at the ship, barking. The dolphins swim away.
JIMBO
All right, you had your fun. Now 
get your ass back over here.
Fin swims toward the ship. He’s drifted out an unsafe 
distance and struggles to get back in. Jimbo tosses out a 
buoy. Fin grabs it with his teeth, enabling Jimbo to pull him 
in. He lifts Fin, panting hard and shivering, out of the 
water.
Fin shakes himself off from his head down to his tail, 
dowsing them in cold salt water. 
Jimbo removes his jacket, throws it around Fin and then holds 
him in his arms. Fin shakes uncontrollably.
JIMBO(CONT'D)
I gotcha, crazy man.
JAMIE
May I?
Jimbo reluctantly releases his protective hold on Fin and 
Jamie takes over. Kneeling on the wet floor, eyes closed, she 
places one hand on his chest, the other on his back. Neither 
of them moves. 
Fin stops shaking. His breathing returns to normal. He poses 
his dripping wet head on her knees, making strange, talking 
sounds. They stare, eye-to-eye, as if in a mutual trance.39."
"40.JAMIE(CONT'D)
There’s something out there - 
something hidden.
Fin barks. Her eyes fixed on Fin, she reaches out and 
squeezes Jimbo’s hand. 
JAMIE(CONT'D)
You know what he’s talking about. 
You know, don’t you?
JIMBO
What? Don’t go getting spooky on me 
now. He needs to eat, that’s what I 
know. He done gone and used up all 
his energy.
Jamie stares into his eyes.
JAMIE
I know you’ve got secrets. And I 
promise not to trespass.
He looks away, averting her gaze.
JIMBO
You OK, boy?
Fin barks at him, rushing back over to the railing and then 
back and forth between him and Jamie.
JIMBO(CONT'D)
That’s enough, you hear me? 
Jamie and Fin follow Jimbo up to the main deck. 
JIMBO(CONT'D)
(to Jamie)
Excuse us. 
EXT. MAIN DECK - DAY
Fin never takes his eyes off Jamie, as Jimbo walks him 
through the door, leaving her on deck.
The first whale spouts blow against the horizon. 
We hear the drone of the zodiac approaching offside ship, 
then the sound of a winch hoisting it back on board. Sam and 
Liz appear in wet suits, carrying fins and masks. Liz looks 
upset. She hands her gear to Sam, and approaches Jamie.
Jamie points out to sea.
JAMIE
Whales.40."
"41.Liz is agitated, shivering.
LIZ
Did you see? I was surrounded by 
Bottlenose dolphins. Big ones.
JAMIE
Where were you? My eyes were on 
Fin. He had three or four with him. 
LIZ
Starboard. Only about three hundred 
feet away. God, the water was 
freezing.
JAMIE
Look up ahead. I’ve seen three 
spouts so far. Are they Orcas?
Liz doesn’t turn to look.
LIZ
I’ve never felt afraid around 
dolphins before. 
Sam walks up, carrying a beach towel.
SAM
Jimbo freaked her out with his 
Tales of the Deep.
LIZ
I felt threatened. No question.
Sam walks back to the gear locker. He steps out of the wet 
suit, showing off a ripped physique.
SAM
Maybe they were in the middle of a 
mating dance. You know what they 
say about dolphins.
LIZ
(ignoring Sam)
It was as if they were trying to 
entrap me. 
JAMIE
“Entrap” you? Dolphins?
SAM
You got overwhelmed, that’s all. It 
happens.
Jamie looks darkly pensive.
JAMIE
They were agitated with Fin, too.41."
"42.SAM
Fin must have spooked the pod.
JAMIE
Jimbo says he’s been swimming with 
dolphins since he was a pup. They 
came calling, like they know him. 
SAM
Right. Don’t you know? They were 
comparing notes with a dog on the 
latest in sardine sandwiches.
Liz turns her back to him, gesturing to him to unzip her, 
talking directly to Jamie.
LIZ
That is the first time I’ve ever 
been afraid around dolphins. 
She peels off the wet suit and wraps herself in the towel, 
shivering. Sam carries it back to the gear locker, where he 
hoses down both suits before hanging them to dry.
LIZ(CONT'D)
Didn’t you get a psychic sense of 
what was happening? It was not 
natural.
JAMIE
My focus was on Fin.
Squinting, Jamie shields her eyes as she looks into the 
bright sunlight.
Sam returns with an oversized fleece jacket, which he places 
over Liz’s shoulders. 
SAM
We need to get you into a hot 
shower.
The dining bell rings.
JAMIE
A bowl of hot soup would help.
Liz nods. She walks away with Sam, looking back at Jamie. 
Jamie picks up her camera and zooms in on the whales. In the 
background, four whale spouts blow high against the horizon. 
JAMIE(CONT'D)
I’m here for you, my beauties. 
Don’t let this ship confuse you. 
I’m here for you.42."
"43.INT. DINING ROOM/LOUNGE - DAY
Platters of food line the table. At Jamie’s place is a 
vegetarian plate. The staff, uniformed now, stand around, 
awaiting Jimbo. Fin lies, listless, next to his untouched 
bowl of food. 
DOMENICO, the ship’s steward, serves drinks. Jimbo appears 
from the hall. The first thing he notices is that Fin hasn’t 
touched his food.
JIMBO
What’s up, boy? You okay? 
Jimbo takes his place at the table. Everyone sits to eat. Fin 
whines, weaving back and forth between Jimbo, Jamie and the 
door. He parks at Jimbo’s side, barking incessantly, and 
heads to the door, looking back. 
Jamie gets out of her chair.
JAMIE
Something’s going on here. 
She follows Fin out to the deck. Jimbo grabs a meatball 
sandwich and follows them out.
EXT. MAIN DECK - DAY
Fin races to the railing and stares out at the ocean, 
searching. Perched up against it on his hind legs, barking, 
his ears turn in and out, like radar, listening to inaudible 
sounds.
JIMBO
One of these times, god help me, 
he’s gonna jump in when I’m not on 
my guard. 
He shakes his head, frowning.
JIMBO(CONT'D)
I try not to worry about that. 
He bites into the sandwich and extracts a meatball for Fin, 
but he snubs it. 
Jamie can’t take her eyes off Fin.
JIMBO(CONT'D)
He’s my family.
Sam pokes his head out the door.
SAM
When you’re ready, you know where 
to find me. 43."
"44.He disappears through the doorway. Jimbo stuffs the rest of 
the sandwich into his mouth.
JIMBO
I asked Sam to give you an overview 
of the tools we mortals use to see 
beneath the waves.
Jamie and Jimbo step back inside, with Fin right behind.
INT. TECH ROOM - DAY
Sam is seated at the desk of a computer station that spans an 
entire wall. Liz is slightly behind him, her chair just 
slightly too close to his. 
Jamie enters. She looks instantly overwhelmed by the complex 
array of electronics. Sam pushes out a chair.
SAM
It’s all directed from here.
LIZ
It’s not as complicated as it 
looks.
Jamie sits down, behind him.
SAM
Where do you want me to start?
JAMIE
I’m concerned about sonar. Tell me 
about that.
SAM
(patronizingly)
Okay. SONAR. We send a pulse into 
the water - we call it pinging. It 
bounces off objects, natural or 
otherwise, and the sea floor.
He types something on the keyboard. A series of 
unintelligible data appears on screen.
SAM(CONT'D)
The problem is we get false 
readings from stuff in between.
JAMIE
“Stuff?” You mean like whales?
SAM
We get echoes from all over. They 
bounce off the valleys and hills 
and cave openings. It makes for a 
lot of misreads.44."
"45.He types on the keyboard. A graph of the sea floor appears on 
one of the monitors.
SAM(CONT'D)
Using the COTS-BASED-OPEN-
ARCHITECTURE SYSTEM we measure 
depths by how long it takes waves 
to hit and bounce back to surface. 
It’s used on all U.S. combat subs. 
He types COTS on the keyboard. A command menu appears.
JAMIE
You’re telling me you’re using 
military capacity sonar?
SAM
Well, yeah. We’ve got state-of-the-
art equipment on this baby.
JAMIE
It’s been reported that Navy sonar 
is making the whales deaf and 
insane, driving them to suicide!
LIZ
That’s never been proven.
JAMIE
I can’t believe this ship utilizes 
military technology. 
SAM
We work with ELF’s - extremely low 
frequency waves. They operate at 
three hundred hertz. Nothing like 
the big guns the military uses. 
Hell, they use MFAS! That operates 
at between three to four thousand 
hertz. Now that shit is bad for the 
whales.
JAMIE
So you’re telling me that private 
corporations are free to use 
weapons-grade military equipment 
out here? 
SAM
(to Liz)
I guess she’s not going to want to 
hear about the TOWED AIRGUN ARRAY.
JAMIE
This is an outrage!45."
"46.SAM
(snidely)
Didn’t Mat Anderson brief you at 
all on what we’re doing out here?
JAMIE
Only to tell me that you were 
failing. Now, what about this 
airgun?
SAM
Imagine a large piston with a 
plunger discharging compressed, 
high-pressure air bubbles into the 
ocean. It forms a pressure wave 
field that gets pushed downward,  
beneath the sea bed, through the 
deeper earth below it, eventually 
reflecting back up to the surface.
JAMIE
That’s got to be great for the 
whales. No wonder they’re dying. 
There’s no sacred space left.
LIZ
I don’t think Jamie needs all the 
intricate details.
SAM
“Sacred space?” There’s no sacred 
space out here. You’ve got massive 
overfishing, tankers, cruise ships, 
freighters, jet skis, boats...
JAMIE
Stop. I get it.
SAM
...military vessels, global naval 
testing, reconnaissance, oil 
drilling, sonar research vessels. 
It’s a virtual disco inferno down 
there. It goes with the territory.
JAMIE
The ocean is not human “territory.” 
SAM
Look, I read and record data. You 
got a problem? Talk to the Captain.
JAMIE
You bet I will. 
Jamie stands up abruptly and heads for the door.46."
"47.SAM
I haven’t even touched on radar.
She storms out. Sam looks at Liz, impishly.
SAM(CONT'D)
That didn’t go very well.
LIZ
You set it up to fail.
SAM
Like they’re not using substrata 
sonar over there in Pakistan? 
What’s the big deal?
LIZ
Don’t you get it? She’s all about 
the whales.
SAM
What about the whales? What did she 
think she was coming out on - the 
Love Boat? 
LIZ
What the hell’s with you, anyway? 
SAM
I’m not going for the X-ray vision 
hype. That’s all.
LIZ
You act like you’re intimidated.
SAM
By a psychic oil hunter?
LIZ
Well ... you do have to admit she’s 
got an amazing track record.
Her strap slips off her shoulder, distracting him. Sam pulls 
the strap up, stroking her neck.
They hear footsteps outside. Sam cracks the window shade to 
see Brady walking past. Liz sees something flicker and zip 
across the screen, while Sam’s got his back to it. She walks 
up behind him and kisses him on the back of the neck.
SAM
There’s this very hot lady blowing 
on the coals of Sammy fire.
In the background, the monitors go black.
Liz reaches around his waist, sliding her hands down over his 
inner thighs.47."
"48.LIZ
Fire me up. 
Sam sits back down, oblivious to the equipment. Liz crawls 
onto his lap and they make out passionately.
CLOSE UP: LIZ’S CELL PHONE
It vibrates across the desk. It reads: REPORT IN. 
INT. CAPTAIN’S BRIDGE - DAY
Jimbo stares at two black monitors, and flips on his mic.
JIMBO
I’ve lost both screens. What the 
hell just happened?
INT. TECH ROOM - DAY
Sam is jolted by Jimbo’s voice. Liz gets up immediately and 
sits back down in her chair. Sam flips on his mic.
SAM
That’s weird. Hold on.
He fiddles with the equipment until the monitors come on. The 
door opens. Jimbo appears unexpectedly at the doorway. 
Liz keeps her back to Jimbo, working at the computer, and 
turns off her phone.
JIMBO
Have we got a problem?
SAM
I have no clue what just happened. 
No way we could have gone down and 
back up in seconds. The system 
would have to completely reboot. 
JIMBO
That’s what I’m thinking. Run 
another check. Where’s Miss Jamie?
SAM
I got as far as the airgun and she 
blasted out of here.
Liz leans closer to the mic.
LIZ
I think that was probably her last 
briefing from Sam.48."
"49.JIMBO
Mind your manners, now - the both 
of you. Miss Jamie is VIP all the 
way. Drop the attitude, Sammo. 
Boss’s orders. 
Sam leans back in his chair, looking like a kid who got 
caught with his hands in the cookie jar.
SAM
Yes, sir.
Jimbo walks out.
INT. HALLWAY TO BRIDGE - DAY
Jimbo walks the hall to the bridge, looking secretive.
INT. CAPTAIN’S BRIDGE - DAY
He enters, closes the door and dials ship-to-shore radio. 
JIMBO
(low voice)
We’re in the zone.
He hangs up without waiting for reply.
EXT. MAIN DECK - DAY (SUNSET)
Fin runs excitedly around deck. Bobby grabs him by the collar 
and leashes him. They walk inside.
INT. CAPTAIN’S BRIDGE - DAY (SUNSET)
Bobby appears with Fin.  
BOBBY
Don’t know what’s up with Fin. He’s 
all over the road. 
Fin goes right to his bed, barely looking up at Jimbo.
JIMBO
Listen up, little guy. You have got 
to cool it. It’s getting old, you 
read me? 
Fin looks up, sighs, and drops his head down between his 
paws.49."
"(MORE)50.INT. DINING ROOM/LOUNGE - NIGHT
The ship is anchored, rocking slightly. Liz and Sam play 
backgammon. Jimbo’s on the couch, watching a movie with Doc.
Jamie enters, looking green. She staggers over to Liz.
LIZ
We missed you at dinner. Chef put 
aside a plate for you.
JAMIE
One thing I am not is hungry.
LIZ
I’ve got Dramamine.
JAMIE
Thanks, but I take no medication.
Jimbo gets up and pulls a beer from the refrigerator.
JIMBO
Beer. There’s nothing better for 
the green meanies.
Jamie takes the beer with trembling hands. Jimbo goes to the 
galley and returns with a plate of plain saltine crackers.
JIMBO(CONT'D)
I guess it’s no Cubanos for you 
tonight. 
Jamie moans at the very mention of the cigars. Across the 
room, in the dining area, Bobby takes a tray of poker chips, 
cards and a note pad from a cabinet.
BOBBY
Who’s up for a little casino 
action?
Sam, Liz and Doc raise their hands and gather around the 
table. Alberto sets up tea and coffee at the buffet. Sitting 
with Jimbo across the room, Jamie struggles to sip the beer 
and nibble on a cracker.
JAMIE
Mat forgot to mention that you have 
weapons-grade sonar equipment on 
this ship.
JIMBO
Sonar isn’t a “weapon.”
JAMIE
Tell that to the whales and 
dolphins. They can’t bear it. 
(MORE)50."
"JAMIE (CONT'D)51.They’re beaching themselves in 
droves because of it. How can you 
let that happen on your watch? 
JIMBO
Man, it has got to be a bitch being 
you. Feeling what you feel.
JAMIE
You don’t have to be psychic to 
feel pain.
She takes another tiny sip.
JAMIE(CONT'D)
Do you have any way of monitoring 
the effects of the ship’s sonar?
JIMBO
Lighten up, Jamie! You’re like a 
dog with a bone! 
JAMIE
Will you admit that a lot of whale 
and dolphin beachings regularly 
occur after Navy sonar tests? With 
all due respect for the military, 
they don’t seem to give a damn 
about the effect of their weapons 
on the environment. 
Sam and Liz look over from the table.
JIMBO
Now hold on a minute, Miss Jamie. I 
won’t have people talking shit 
about the Navy. The military is 
trying to protect the world - not 
destroy it.
JAMIE
That’s a laugh! You don’t really 
believe that, do you?
JIMBO
They’re protecting the borders.
JAMIE
“Borders?” In the ocean?
Liz throws in her cards.
LIZ
I’ve got a bad headache. I’m out.
She sashays to the buffet and pours herself a cup of tea. Sam 
covets her from behind as she walks out. JAMIE (CONT'D)51."
"52.He stares at Jamie accusingly, throwing in his cards. 
SAM
I’m out, too. Sorry guys.
JIMBO
(to Jamie)
You see now? 
Disgruntled, Doc and Bobby tally up and put things back in 
the cabinet. 
JIMBO(CONT'D)
It serves no purpose talking like 
that. No purpose whatsoever.
Touching Jimbo’s arm, she looks deeply into his eyes.
JAMIE
The oceans are being systematically 
destroyed and sonar is decimating 
the whales! We have to give a damn, 
or there’s no future for this 
planet. Unlock your heart, Jimbo. 
JIMBO
Jesus, Jamie. Don’t. I live and 
breathe the sea. It’s my life. You 
been out here a few hours.
JAMIE
You live it, but you don’t belong 
to it. It’s their world you’re 
destroying - for profit.
JIMBO
We’re all just doing our jobs. 
People out here, we just don’t want 
to go there.
JAMIE
And nobody cares about the whales? 
Military grade sonar, air guns. Who 
is willing to “go there?” Who?
Fin barks loudly at Jimbo.
JIMBO
Damn. Two against one here. You’re 
a pair, I tell ya’. A real pair.
INT. JAMIE’S STATEROOM - NIGHT
Jamie undresses, peering out at sea. Humpbacks breeching 
under full moon hypnotize her. She snaps a picture, crawls 
into bed and falls asleep, tossing and turning fitfully.52."
"53.MONTAGE - DREAM SEQUENCE - JAMIE ON THE BEACH - NIGHT
--Jamie is in a soaked nightgown on wet sand, surrounded by 
dead whales. More keep coming in to die.
--She implores them to head back out. Some are already dead 
before they wash ashore.
--She walks up close to a humpback whale, stroking her body 
and imploring her to return to the deep. A giant tear 
splashes from the whale’s eye over her hand. The whale dies, 
staring into Jamie’s tormented soul.
BACK TO SCENE:
INT. JAMIE’S STATEROOM - NIGHT
Jamie wakes up in a fit. She turns on a light and reaches for 
the camera, searching the finder for the shot she captured 
earlier. She’s shocked when, instead, she sees a close-up of 
a whale’s eye. She bolts out of bed and hurriedly gets 
dressed to leave. 
Fin lies sleeping in the hallway outside her door. She bends 
down to greet him and he jumps up on her, playfully.
JAMIE
(whispering)
Boy, am I glad to see you. Come on. 
Coffee needed here.
He barks.
JAMIE(CONT'D)
Shush. People sleeping. Be cool.
She grabs her jacket and camera. They head to the galley.
INT. GALLEY - NIGHT
Jamie fumbles around until she locates the coffee, bread and 
jam. She preps the coffee pot and drops two slices of bread 
in the toaster. She feeds Fin the first slice. 
In the background, through the window - the distant hint of 
sunrise.
Whales slap their flukes against the water’s surface. She 
places the coffee and toast on a tray and exits.
INT. DINING ROOM/LOUNGE - NIGHT
Jamie carries the tray to the sofa. Fin curls up at her feet. 
When she’s finished eating, he jumps up next to her. She lies 
down, her head on Fin’s back, and they fall asleep. 53."
"54.The distinct sound of a WHALE CALL awakens them both. She and 
Fin race back to the galley.
INT. GALLEY - NIGHT
Full moon. Its eerie, supernatural light casts an 
otherworldly reflection on the water.
Jamie strains to see whales breaching ahead of the ship. She 
becomes transfixed, almost hypnotized by the glowing radiance 
that seems to emanate from the sea.
Alarmed, she searches the key rack on the wall until she 
finds the one tagged: TECH ROOM. 
She grabs the key and tiptoes into the hall with Fin. 
INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Jamie turns the key, furtively, and enters. 
INT. TECH ROOM - NIGHT
She examines the master board and flicks a switch. Monitors 
light up. She fiddles with a few dials and switches. 
Fin sits just outside the door, alert.
JAMIE
Oh, great computer God, talk to me.
INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
She rushes down the corridor, past Sam’s cabin. She places 
her hand on the door, eyes closed, and then knocks. In 
nothing but boxer shorts, Sam cracks the door. Through a slit 
in the doorway, Jamie notices Liz, naked, in bed.
JAMIE
Sorry to disturb you, but I need to 
know where we are in relation to 
the sanctuary.
SAM
You’ve got to be kidding me. It’s 
not even five in the morning!
JAMIE
Five? Thank god it’s that late.
SAM
Five, Jamie - five a.m.!54."
"55.JAMIE
I know. I’m mortified. Look, I took 
a big liberty and tried to turn on 
the equipment myself, but I don’t 
know what I’m doing.
SAM
Shit! I’m running a systems check. 
Why would you do that?
In the background, Liz throws on Sam’s shirt and comes to the 
door. 
LIZ
What on earth is going on?
JAMIE
It’s the Orcas. They’re amassing 
not far ahead of the ship. I think 
we’ve entered the sanctuary.
SAM
You can’t fuck with the equipment! 
He sighs, exaggerating exasperation.
SAM(CONT'D)
Let me get my pants on.
He closes the door in Jamie’s face.
INT. SAM’S CABIN - NIGHT
Liz searches for her clothes, strewn around the room. Sam 
gets into his pants.
SAM
I so did not sign up to sail with 
this whack job.
LIZ
Aren’t you a little bit curious 
after what happened to me with the 
dolphins?  
SAM
I refuse to engage in a Save the 
Whales campaign at five a.m. Keep 
the bed warm.
INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
Tucking in his shirt, Sam steps out into the hall. He, Jamie 
and Fin race up to the office.55."
"56.INT. TECH ROOM - NIGHT
Sam inspects equipment. Jamie has only turned on monitors. 
Sam looks relieved, but annoyed.
SAM
I can’t believe you would just walk 
in here and mess with the 
equipment. You have no idea.
JAMIE
Sorry. I didn’t want to have to 
wake you up. There’s a danger...
SAM
There’s always someone on the 
bridge.
JAMIE
How would I know that? 
SAM
What part of your psychic genius am 
I missing?
JAMIE
I need to know for certain if we’ve 
entered the sanctuary.
SAM
The system’s tied up another hour. 
Hear me, Jamie: nothing is fixed 
out here. There’s no boundaries or 
borders in the ocean. For fuck’s 
sake! You just cannot obsess about 
this shit.
He turns off the monitors.
SAM(CONT'D)
Don’t ever do that again. I don’t 
care how important you are ... I’m 
the Chief technician here. You need 
answers? Go to the bridge and 
follow protocol.
JAMIE
Protocol? I wouldn’t even know 
where to find a life jacket. Who do 
I go to for that?
Sam turns out the light and locks the door as they all exit.
INT. DINING ROOM/LOUNGE - DAY (SUNRISE)
Coffee and donuts at the buffet. Alberto whistles “O SOLE 
MIO” in the galley. Jamie’s camera sits on the dining table. 56."
"57.She slips the strap over her head, fills a mug and heads out 
with Fin. 
EXT. MAIN DECK - DAY (SUNRISE)
In the background, there’s a huge pod of Orcas ahead of the 
ship. Several breach in the light of dawn, breaking on the 
horizon. 
SOUNDS OF MORNING: THE CREW MOVING ABOUT, CLANGING POTS, 
SCREECHING SEAGULLS.
We hear Jimbo and Alberto inside. Fin runs in, leaving Jamie 
staring out at sea, shivering. 
Jamie observes Orcas closer now. Calves breach with their 
mothers in inestimable numbers. Jolted from the sound of 
grinding motors, she looks up at top deck. 
Radar equipment and antennae begin to spin. The ship moves 
straight ahead, towards the super pod. 
INT. DINING ROOM/LOUNGE - DAY
Jimbo pours himself a cup of coffee. Jamie rushes past him 
and runs up the stairs to the upper deck.
INT. TECH ROOM - DAY
She bursts in on Sam, breathless.
JAMIE
You need to turn it all off.
SAM
Well now, what will it be, ma’am? 
Off, on ... on, off. What?
JAMIE
There’s a big pod of Orcas up ahead 
and there are babies - a lot of 
them.
SAM
You can’t go ballistic every time 
you see a few whales. 
She storms out without even answering.
Sam sits watching the screen, sipping his coffee, when, 
suddenly, he catches a blip on the radar. He sits up 
attentively, and zooms in. It rockets across the screen and 
disappears. Another blip appears right behind it, he takes a 
snapshot and it, too, disappears. 57."
"58.He freezes the image, prints it, and rushes to the bridge.
INT. CAPTAIN’S BRIDGE - DAY
Sam walks in on a heated exchange between Jimbo and Jamie.
JIMBO
We’re no threat to any whales - 
relax. 
JAMIE
Are you kidding me? It’s a nursery! 
Did you or did you not get briefed 
by Mat Anderson? 
Jimbo leans past Jamie.
JIMBO
What’s up, Sambo?
SAM
Can I speak to you in private, sir?
JIMBO
Talk to me. 
He glances uncomfortably at Jamie.
SAM
Take a look at this.
He places the print on Jimbo’s desk.
JIMBO
What the hell is that - a sub? What 
was its position?
Jamie steps in closer.
SAM
Two miles ahead, a half-mile down.
Jimbo looks up at the radar tracking screens.
JIMBO
I don’t see anything.
SAM
There were two blips. They 
disappeared immediately.
JIMBO
Didn’t you double check the 
equipment? Sounds like we’ve got a 
glitch in the system.
Sam glares, accusingly, at Jamie.58."
"59.SAM
Ran it last night. It checks out.
JIMBO 
Well then, it’s probably nothing. 
He folds the paper in half and places it in the desk drawer. 
Sam looks curiously at Jimbo.
SAM
“Nothing,” Captain?
JIMBO
It’s gone, isn’t it?
SAM
If you say so, Sir.
He walks out, perplexed.
JAMIE
It’s definitely something. Can I 
see that?
He takes the print out from the drawer and hands it to her.
JIMBO
Can you get a hit from that?
JAMIE
I can try.
She closes her eyes and holds her left palm over the image.
JAMIE(CONT'D)
Do you believe there's an E.T. 
presence on this planet?
JIMBO
(cagily)
Should I?
She opens her eyes and looks piercingly at Jimbo.
JAMIE
Shouldn't we all, Captain Jim?
JIMBO
Well now, if you find little green 
men running submarines twenty-
thousand-leagues under the sea, 
I'll believe in just about 
anything.
Brady’s voice comes through the walkie-talkie over the desk.
BRADY (O.S.) 
Captain, can you hear me?59."
"60.JIMBO
Yeah, what’s up?
BRADY (O.S.)
Main deck, sir. We have a 
situation.
JIMBO
This is no way to start the day.
(into walkie-talkie)
What kind of situation?
BRADY (O.S.)
A bunch of Humpbacks have come in 
close around the ship.
JIMBO’S POV - THROUGH BINOCULARS - DAY 
He sees the huge pod of Orcas ahead, and several Humpbacks 
moving in on the ship.
JAMIE
“No threat to the whales,” huh? 
She races out.
JAMIE (O.S.)(CONT'D)
Tell Sam to cut the damned sonar!
EXT. MAIN DECK - DAY
Jamie explodes through the door. Fin is glued to the railing. 
The ship is surrounded by several massive Humpbacks. In the 
background, more whales approach. Brady approaches, almost 
dazed.
BRADY
I have never seen any whale 
behavior like this.
Whales are frenzied, slapping their flukes hard on the waves, 
closing in on all sides of the ship. Brady calls again.
BRADY(CONT'D)
Captain? You really need to come 
down here. 
JIMBO (O.S.)
Damn. Hold your horses! 
Jamie looks up at top deck to see the array of equipment 
spinning full on. She grabs the walkie-talkie.
JAMIE
Cut the freaking sonar immediately! 60."
"61.The scene in the ocean is riveting. So many whales, the water 
looks as black as an oil slick. Humpbacks swim with Orcas, 
their natural predators. Dolphins too. 
Liz appears in the doorway, terrified. Everyone on board, 
except Jimbo and Sam, is out on deck, transfixed.
Jamie covers her ears, Fin barks incessantly. She fixates on 
the sonar array, which slows and finally comes to a full 
stop.
INT. HALLWAY - CAPTAIN’S BRIDGE - DAY
Approaching, Jamie overhears Jimbo talking. She stands next 
to the entrance to the bridge, furtively, listening.
JIMBO (O.S.)
...I had to, boss. I have a bitch 
of a situation out here.
MAT ANDERSON (V.O)
How the fuck could you “lose” it? 
Fire back up.
JIMBO (O.S.)
We've got a whole bunch of 
seriously pissed off whales holding 
the ship hostage, man.
MAT ANDERSON (V.O)
I don't give a goddamn about a 
bunch of whales - do you read me?
JIMBO (O.S.)
Sir, do you read me? I'm talkin' 
we’re surrounded by ... how many 
tons of whale muscle? The ship 
isn't that big. It’s an emergency. 
Over.
MAT ANDERSON (V.O.)
Am I really hearing this? The 
Deepwater is being held hostage by 
a bunch of fucking whales? 
INT. CAPTAIN’S BRIDGE - DAY
Jamie enters, distraught. She catches Jimbo off guard.
JIMBO
Incoming call ... Coast Guard. 
Gotta sign out. Over.
JAMIE
I'm begging you. Cut the engines. 61."
"62.JIMBO
No time for this right now, Jamie.
He picks up the ship-to-shore radio.
JIMBO(CONT'D)
This is Deepwater - do you read? 
VOICE ON RADIO (V.O.)
Yes, we read you. 
JIMBO
I'm passing through the sanctuary 
and I'm in a little trouble. Over.
VOICE ON RADIO (V.O.)
Hold on, I’ll get Tom.
TOM (V.O.)
Hey Jimbo. 
JIMBO
You better sit down for this. I'm 
surrounded by a bunch of Humpbacks, 
up close. Can’t even count’m. Huge 
Orca congregation ahead. Not sure 
how to move. In holding position. 
We’re in trouble, all right. Over.
TOM (V.O.)
Did I hear you correctly, Captain?
JIMBO
You heard me right. I’m completely 
surrounded and there’s more 
swimming in. They’re in aggressive 
behavior mode - directed at the 
ship. Over.
TOM (V.O.)
(lightheartedly)
You been drinking on duty again? 
JIMBO
This is no joke, Tommy boy. They’re 
in a frenzy like nothing I ever 
seen. They’re everywhere - and 
they’re closing in on us. What's 
the best course of action? Over.
INT. COAST GUARD OFFICE - DAY
TOM GONZALES, the officer in charge, sits in front of a mic. 
TWO UNIFORMED MEN, their backs to him, stare at computer 
screens. They roll their chairs over to listen.
INTERCUT PHONE SEQUENCE:62."
"63.TOM
There is no Coast Guard protocol 
for a whale attack. Over.
He looks over at his colleagues, and winks.
JIMBO
Well, Hell, Tommy - you think I 
don’t know that? There’s no punch 
line coming here. This is an 
emergency. 
TOM
Then get yourself out of there. 
What’s holding you up? Over. 
JIMBO
Well, here you go: if I move, I 
could have a massive slaughter on 
my hands. If I sit and wait it out, 
hell. There's enough muscle out 
there to capsize the ship. Over.
TOM 
Stand by. 
Tom leans back in his chair. The three men stare at each 
other, nonplussed.
TOM(CONT'D)
Cut your engines. You’ve got enough 
steel in the water to hold your 
position. Wait for them to move on 
and keep us informed. Over and out.
INT. CAPTAIN’S BRIDGE - DAY
Jimbo cuts the engines. He places the radio back on the hook 
and throws on his jacket. Bobby walks in.
BOBBY
What’s our course of action, 
Captain?
JIMBO
Not sure yet. Take over here.
Jimbo stashes the walkie-talkie into his jacket pocket. He 
and Jamie run out.
EXT. MAIN DECK - DAY
Fin runs circles around the ship, barking non-stop.
Jamie and Jimbo explode out the door on deck. Jamie manages 
to grab Fin by the collar, as he runs past.63."
"64.JAMIE
Fin! Shush now! Be still!
(to Brady)
Do we have a hydrophone?
Brady nods and looks over at Sam.
JAMIE(CONT'D)
No high-tech stuff. Have you got a 
good old-fashioned hydrophone?
BRADY
Yes, on lower deck.
JIMBO
I don’t like it. Throw a phone out 
right now? We’ll lose it for sure. 
They’ll be swallowing it, at the 
very least.
JAMIE
(ignoring Jimbo)
Let’s get it. 
She and Brady race down the stairs, with Fin following.
JIMBO
Okay everybody - you heard the 
lady. 
EXT. LOWER DECK - DAY
Brady disappears into the equipment room and emerges with the 
hydrophone on a one-hundred-foot coil. 
Jamie takes the hydrophone. She leans over the railing and 
lowers it, just missing a big Humpback, who’s dangerously 
close to the ship. She places the headphones over her ears.
She hears torturous WHALE CRIES and SCREAMS. Reeling, Jamie 
rips off the phones and hands them to Brady.
JAMIE
Listen to this.
He places them over his ears and recoils from the sounds.
JAMIE(CONT'D)
Can you hook this up to speakers? 
Brady nods. He looks absolutely stunned.
JAMIE(CONT'D)
I want everybody to hear this, 
especially Sam.64."
"65.Whales move in closer on the ship. They swim three and four 
deep. The enormous Humpback scrapes up against the side. 
Others hit their bodies against the hull, rocking the ship. 
Jamie looks down from the railing. She sees the huge whale’s 
eye staring straight up at her. 
She looks back at Jimbo, pointing at the mighty whale.
JAMIE(CONT'D)
“Please help us,” she said. Oh my 
god, Jim, this whale is speaking to 
me. Can you hear? Can you hear 
that? 
WHALE DISTRESS CALLS BLAST LOUDLY THROUGH SPEAKERS.
The frenzy grows more violent. Jamie leans dangerously over 
the railing. She and the whale make eye-to-eye contact.
FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)
Help us, Emissary, before all are 
gone. Help us!
JAMIE
Can no one else hear this? 
Fin joins Jamie at the railing. He barks wildly, never taking 
his eyes off the whale below. Jamie leans way over, in 
communion with the whale.
JAMIE(CONT'D)
How can we help you? Speak to me! 
The whale rolls over on her side in distress. Her big eye 
stares up at Jamie. Jamie sees the hydrophone cord has 
wrapped itself around her blowhole and entangled her. The big 
humpback becomes severely agitated, slapping her fluke 
furiously. 
Jamie grapples with the cord, reaching so far over the 
railing she nearly falls overboard. She loses her footing, 
slips, hitting her head violently, and gashes her forehead, 
before crashing to the floor. Blood gushes over her face and 
trickles down onto the deck.
The first to see it happen, Jimbo runs to her side.
JIMBO
Jesus! Where’s Doc? Get him over 
here - STAT!
He kneels down beside her, rips off his jacket and covers 
her. She tries to speak, but she’s incoherent. Jimbo removes 
his sweater, rolls it up and places it under her head.65."
"66.JIMBO(CONT'D)
Don’t try to move. Don’t move, 
baby. 
He looks frantic.
JIMBO(CONT'D)
Where the hell is Doc? Move, 
people! Dom, get blankets!
Doc smashes the glass, pulls out the first aid kit and rushes 
to Jamie. He treats the wound as best he can, bandaging her 
head to stop the bleeding, but the gauze becomes blood-soaked 
instantly.
Jimbo never lets go of her hand. 
Fin is inconsolable. He runs back and forth, trying to get 
close to Jamie, barking uncontrollably.
JIMBO(CONT'D)
Berto, get that damned dog locked 
up and don’t let him out - he’s no 
help right now!
DOC
I need to sew her up.
Jamie mutters, incoherently.
JAMIE
It’s hidden... 
With Doc tending Jamie, Jimbo moves into action.
Horrific WHALE CRIES blast from the speakers.
JIMBO
(to Brady)
Cut the fucking cord off that whale 
and kill the speakers! 
(into walkie-talkie)
Get the Guard - we need back up.
DOC
She needs a hospital. Code Red.
JIMBO
(into walkie-talkie)
Make that Code Red, Bobby! We need 
a copter.
Dominic rushes over with a medical bag and blankets. Jimbo 
tucks them around Jamie’s trembling body. Her face is ice 
white. She stares up at him.66."
"67.JAMIE
Don’t let them ... the towers ... 
the music ... please help us.
She tries to lift her head. 
JIMBO
Don’t try to move, angel. Jimbo’s 
here. Doc gonna fix you up.
Doc unwraps the blood-soaked gauze. Jamie’s hair is matted 
with blood and still more gushes from the deep gash. He 
shaves the hair around the wound, swathes it in Betadine, and 
administers a local anesthetic. 
Liz stands watching, immobilized, in panic.
DOC
There’s a needle and thread in that 
kit.
Liz just stares at him, blankly.
DOC(CONT'D)
Come on kid, snap out of it! 
Liz kneels next to him, rifling through the first aid kit. 
She finds a packet, marked SUTURE and hands it over. Doc 
struggles to get latex gloves over blood-soaked hands. 
Jamie writhes, trying to speak. Liz strains to hear. Jimbo 
puts his ear to Jamie’s mouth and cups his hand between them. 
JAMIE
(in a whisper)
They’re using you, Jimbo. They want 
to kill everything. Everything...
She blacks out. 
His hands covered in blood, Jimbo looks anxiously at Doc. Doc 
shakes his head, checking for a pulse.
DOC
We need that copter.
In the background, the big Humpback swims away.
THE HYDROPHONE SINKS DOWN INTO THE DARK OCEAN. AN EERIE LIGHT 
SHINES ON IT AS IT HITS BOTTOM.
Jimbo talks into the walkie-talkie.
JIMBO
How long for that copter, Bobby?67."
"68.BOBBY (O.S.)
Twenty-five minutes. Anderson 
called, asking for an update.
JIMBO
What did you tell him?
BOBBY (O.S.)
I told him you had everything under 
control, sir.
JIMBO
Right on. That’s our official line, 
until things are sorted. Any 
questions come to me and me alone.
DOC
I’ve got things stabilized for the 
moment. Do what you need to do.
Jimbo stands to look out at the frenzied whales slapping 
their flukes down hard on the surface, spraying the ship with 
huge sheets of water.
JIMBO
Listen up, people. The minute 
Jamie’s on that copter, we move 
out, no matter what. We leave 
quietly: no GPS ... no radar ... 
nothing. 
Sam nods, his eyes averting Jimbo’s. 
JIMBO(CONT'D)
Okay let’s move. Dom, Berto - grab 
the gurney. 
DOC
Bring the head brace. It’s in the 
supply cabinet. And more blankets.
Jimbo runs upstairs. Doc secures the brace on Jamie. He 
collapses the gurney and moves it close to her body, looking 
up at Alberto and Domenico.
DOC(CONT'D)
We’ve got to be real careful here. 
The two of them lift Jamie carefully onto the gurney and 
strap her in. They carry her up the steep steel stairs. 
Doc throws unused supplies into the kit, looking back 
ominously at the bloodstained deck. He tears off the gloves, 
and follows the men upstairs, calling back to Liz.
DOC(CONT'D)
Tell Mike to get somebody out here 
to scrub that out.68."
"69.LIZ
I’m going with her.
DOC
You’ll have to have the Captain’s 
permission for that.
LIZ
I don’t need permission. 
DOC
You sure as hell do. Now do it!
LIZ
Don’t let them fly without me.
She follows him up the stairs.
INT. CAPTAIN’S BRIDGE - DAY
Jimbo looks out from the bridge. The whales are still tight 
in against the ship, but the frenzy has calmed. 
CLOSE UP: JIMBO’S CELL PHONE. 
He types out an SMS.
INSERT: ACCIDENT. JAMIE BAD HEAD INJURY - MEDIVAC EN ROUTE. 
HEADING IN. WILL GET BACK WHEN I KNOW MORE.
A helicopter whirs overhead.

PILOT’S POV - LOOKING DOWN ON THE SHIP FROM HIS WINDOW.  
The ship is surrounded by fifty or more whales, looking like 
a kid’s toy boat stuck in a creek bed. 
PILOT
What the fuck?
(into mic)
Deepwater, we’re coming in for a 
landing.
EXT. SHIP AT SEA - HELIPAD - DAY
The helicopter puts down on ship, which is holding steady.
A MEDIC opens the hatch. Jimbo and Doc wheel Jamie in. Liz 
walks right past Jimbo, agitatedly engaged in conversation on 
her phone, and boards. He looks at her, curiously, but says 
nothing. They close the hatch and take off instantly.69."
"70.In the b.g, a mass of humpback whales surround the ship, many 
of them spy-hopping out of the water, watch and wait.
INT. E.R. - TREATMENT ROOM - NIGHT
In a hospital gown and fresh bandages, Jamie lies unconscious 
on a gurney. She’s hooked up to monitors displaying weak 
vital signs.
HOSPITAL STAFF keep checking on her. She shows no sign of 
coming out of coma.
DREAM SEQUENCE: JAMIE’S NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCE
--Jamie swims joyfully in clear blue waters, surrounded by 
whales and dolphins leaping and gliding all around her. 
--Sound is an otherworldly musical symphony of WHALE CALLS 
and CELESTIAL MUSIC. 
--She’s lifted to the surface on the whale’s back. The whale 
breaches into the air and floats upward, into space. 
--She observes a galactic light show: whales and dolphins 
weaving threads of golden light around the stars. 
--They plunge back into the ocean. A group of dolphins greets 
her on re-entry, illuminating her body, bouncing dolphin 
sounds off her form: a musical tune-up.
--Dolphins guide Jamie through a tunnel. Darkness. The only 
light emanates from the dolphins’ eyes. Lights shine at the 
end of the tunnel. A colony of lighted domes; motherships.
--She sees the hydrophone poking out of the sand.
--Musical bubbling sounds emanate from the mother ships - the 
melodic songs of whale calls respond. 
--Jamie is afloat, in bliss, with dolphins.

--A monstrous BLAST rips through the ocean and the melodic 
call of whale song turn to SCREAMS. The colony vanishes

BACK TO SCENE:
INT. E.R. - TREATMENT ROOM - LATER
Dr. Varja stands at the foot of Jamie's bed, reading her 
chart, discussing her condition with the nurse. He notices 
activity on monitors. 
DR. VARJA
Come on, Jamie - open those eyes!
Jamie blinks a few times and slowly opens her eyes. She looks 
up at the doctor, glazed and disoriented, struggling to form 
the words.72."
"73.JAMIE
Where am I?
DR. VARJA
You're in the hospital. There was 
an accident. Do you remember?
She shakes her head, delirious.
JAMIE
The city of lights...

railing. Do you remember that?
JAMIE
Stop the killing drums.

So much pain! 
Dr. Varja turns to the nurse.

We’re going to have to sedate.
JAMIE
We have to help them! Please help 
them! 73."
"74.Jamie becomes hysterical. Determined to get out of bed, she 
rips the needle out of her hand. Blood trickles over her 
pulse. The nurse holds her hand up, applying pressure. Varja 
and nurse replace the needle and hook her back up to the 
drip.
DR. VARJA
You’re by no way out of the woods 
here and you’re going to have to  
cooperate. Do you understand me?
JAMIE
(crying)
Let me go. I want to go back.
DR. VARJA
(to the nurse)
Infuse half a milligram of 
Midazolam.
The nurse exits and returns with a hypodermic needle, which 
she injects into the drip. Jamie responds quickly. Her eyes 
get heavy and close.
DR. VARJA(CONT'D)
Stay with her.
Dr. Varja exits. 
INT. E.R. - HALLWAY - NIGHTS
Dr. Varja finds Liz lurking, within ear's reach.
LIZ
Is she okay?
DR. VARJA
You are?
LIZ
Elizabeth. I flew in with her. 
DR. VARJA
Are you family?
LIZ
No. I’m with the crew. We haven’t 
reached her family yet. Please. How 
is she? 
DR. VARJA
She’s still extremely disoriented. 
Her speech is slurred, she’s having 
hallucinations. 
LIZ
What do you mean?74."
"75.DR. VARJA
Something about drums and a “city 
of lights” out there. She clearly 
does not know where she is at the 
moment. Light triggering often 
indicates pressure on the soft 
tissue, so we’re concerned about 
bleeding in the brain. She also 
suffered cardiac arrest. 
LIZ
Oh, my god. Poor Jamie.
DR. VARJA
What exactly happened out there?
LIZ
We were caught up in a freak 
situation. Tons of whales attacking 
the ship. It was a frenzy. So 
terrifying. One minute she was 
standing there, the next she was 
down, soaked in blood. Insane.
DR. VARJA
Whales? Attacking a ship? 
LIZ
Don’t ask me to explain it. I 
can’t.
DR. VARJA
Does she suffer from epilepsy?
LIZ
I don’t really know anything about 
her. We only just met a few days 
ago.
DR. VARJA
We need to know what medications 
she’s on.
LIZ
Sorry, I didn’t think to grab her 
bag. But she did say she never 
takes meds, I remember that. Not 
even dramamine.
He leads her to the nurses’ station, where he deposits 
Jamie’s chart in the rack.

Liz sits in a chair next to Jamie, who’s asleep in the bed. 
The privacy curtain is pulled on the side facing the window. 
Jamie struggles to wake up. She opens her eyes, groggily, and 
sees Liz.
JAMIE
How did you get here?
LIZ
I was with you when they flew us in 
by helicopter. You had a really bad 
fall. But you're here now. You’re 
safe.
Jamie looks at the curtain, back-lit with the light from an 
almost full moon. She sees a shadowy silhouette of a man.
JAMIE
“Safe?” Nobody’s “safe.” Do you 
know there are towers ... sound 
wave emitters?
Jamie touches her fingers to her head, running them lightly 
over the bandages. She grimaces from the pain.
JAMIE(CONT'D)
There’s a whole network, blasting 
the oceans ... they’re disrupting 
the music of the whales.
The nurse enters before Liz can answer.76."
"77.NURSE
You're awake! 
She pushes the foot pedal raising the head of the bed and 
helps Jamie, wincing from pain, to sit up enough to swallow 
several pills.
JAMIE
My head. It’s worse. So much worse.
NURSE
I'll get Doctor.
The nurse bolts out of the room.
Jamie grabs Liz’s arm and instantly her arm twitches. She 
recoils, instinctively, as if she’s just touched a hot iron.
JAMIE
There's a whole civilization. A 
million or more.
LIZ
Where? Where did you see it?
JAMIE
Below the sanctuary. Why do you 
think they gather there?
Jamie's eyes are at half-mast. 
LIZ
Who? Who gathers there? Who are 
they, Jamie?
JAMIE
The whales. They're the guardians. 
They're the ... the ... musicians.
LIZ
No, I mean the beings. Who...
The nurse returns with Dr. Varja, as Liz is mid-sentence. He 
asks her to step outside and moves in close to Jamie. Liz 
stands by the door, agitated, but she never leaves the room.
DR. VARJA
Where are you feeling this pain? 
JAMIE
Behind the eyes. It's excruciating.
DR. VARJA
What prescription meds do you take?
JAMIE
No meds. Ever.77."
"78.He takes an ophthalmoscope from his coat pocket and examines 
Jamie's pupils, shining bright light into each eye.
DR. VARJA
(to nurse)
I want that CT and MRI immediately.
(to Jamie)
We need to contact your next of 
kin. Who do we call?
Jamie struggles to remember.
JAMIE
My mom, Amanda. I can’t remember 
the number. 415 ... 3 ... wait. 415 
... 415. San Francisco. 
DR. VARJA
It’s okay. We’ll find her.
The nurse enters again.
NURSE
They’re making room for her now.
Liz walks past him as he walks out.
JAMIE
(imploringly)
I need Jimbo. 
Liz strokes Jamie’s hair.
An ORDERLY arrives.
JAMIE(CONT'D)
It’s one minute to midnight. Who 
will save them? Who?
The orderly wheels Jamie out the door. Liz pulls back the 
privacy curtain. 
The embodiment of evil, DR. EMERY WELLS sits in the penumbra, 
next to the empty bed. His black, emotionless eyes seem to 
suck what little light there is out of the room. 
CLOSE UP: EMERY WELL’S MOUTH. HIS THIN, TIGHT LIPS REVEAL 
STAINED, CROOKED TEETH.
He stands up, acknowledging Liz, and they walk out together.
INT. I.C.U. - HALLWAY - NIGHT
Dr. Varja approaches.78."
"79.DR. VARJA
Dr. Wells - at this time of night?
DR. WELLS
I’m here for the Hastings woman. 
She’s been in treatment with me 
over a year now. She suffers from 
occasional episodes of delirium, 
extreme anxiety and almost phobic 
paranoia. I’m transferring her to 
the Facility.
DR. VARJA
She can’t be moved!
DR. WELLS
I don’t recall ever having had to 
explain myself to a resident.
DR. VARJA
Doctor, she’s in critical 
condition. Have you read her chart? 
She needs twenty-four hour 
surveillance.
DR. WELLS
Release her and sign her over to my 
care immediately. 
DR. VARJA
But we’re still waiting for tests!
DR. WELLS
Send them over. We ARE a medical 
facility, part of this hospital, in 
case you've forgotten.
Wells puts his hand on Liz's shoulder, turning his back on 
Varja, who stands in the middle of the hallway, looking 
completely baffled. 
Wells walks her around the corner, in front of the visitor's 
lounge, and slips a syringe into her purse.
DR. WELLS(CONT'D)
Let’s make sure she doesn’t reveal 
anything else, shall we?
LIZ
I didn’t sign up for murder.
DR. WELLS
It's a sedative. Within the hour 
she's on her way and you disappear. 
Meet me outside. 
They walk back around the corner, approaching the nurses’ 
station. Dr. Varja is there, reviewing Jamie’s chart.79."
"80.LIZ
What do I do about Sam? He’ll be 
calling.
DR. WELLS
Tell him she’s fine, sedated, no 
visitors. Then lose your phone.
He takes a cell phone from his pocket and hands it to her.
DR. WELLS(CONT'D)
You won’t be speaking to anyone 
else for a few days. Clear?
Liz nods. She slips the phone into her purse and walks back 
into Jamie’s room. Dr. Wells approaches Dr. Varja.
DR. WELLS(CONT'D)
Sign the release. I want this 
patient in an ambulance and on her 
way within the hour. 
Dr. Varja watches Wells slither away down the hall, until he 
disappears from sight.
INT. I.C.U. - JAMIE’S ROOM - NIGHT
Liz calls Sam on her old cell phone.
SAM (V.O.)
I was just about to call you. News?
LIZ
She’s stable. They think the worst 
is over.
SAM (V.O.)
Phew! How are you holding up?
LIZ
I’m knackered. I’m taking a room in 
town.
SAM (V.O.)
You want company?
LIZ
(coldly)
Goodbye, Sam. 
She removes the phone back, extracts the chip, and exits.80."
"81.INT. I.C.U. - HALLWAY - NIGHT
Liz walks past the nurses’ station to a bin marked: HAZARDOUS 
BIO-WASTE. She tosses the phone and chip inside, and returns 
to Jamie’s room.
INT. I.C.U. - JAMIE’S ROOM - NIGHT
Liz sits waiting. The orderly rolls Jamie back in, followed 
by the nurse. Liz stands by Jamie’s bedside, waiting. 
LIZ
Heya.
JAMIE
(drowsily)
Did you call Jimbo? 
LIZ
Yes, I've assured him everything is 
under control.
JAMIE
But it’s not. 
LIZ
The doctor said you were 
hallucinating and very unstable. 
JAMIE
I was on the other side.
LIZ
You mean when you flat-lined?
Jamie’s in a daze, confused.
LIZ (CONT'D)
You told him you were underwater, 
swimming around with whales. 
JAMIE
There’s an entire civilization. The 
whales took me there. They’re 
trying to kill them, they're 
killing everything, everything... 
LIZ
Who? Who’s killing whom?
JAMIE
(slurring her speech)
It’s the final war for planet 
earth. 
She keeps slipping out of consciousness.81."
"82.LIZ
Tell me more about this city. The 
city, Jamie!
JAMIE
The whales ... they’re ... they’re 
the guardians. 
LIZ
What are they doing down there, 
Jamie? Could you see?
JAMIE’S POV: 
The image of a black Venetian mask passes over Liz’s face. 
Through her blurred vision, Jamie is terrified when she sees 
a ghostly black shadow against the wall behind Liz.
JAMIE
Oh, God. You walk on that side. How 
did I miss that? How could I?
Panicking, she scrambles for the call button, but she can’t 
reach it. She screams for the nurse.
INT. I.C.U. - HALLWAY - NIGHT
Jamie’s SCREAMS echo down the hall. 
There’s nobody at the nurse’s station. Jamie’s emergency 
light blinks and goes unnoticed, unanswered.
INT. I.C.U. - JAMIE’S ROOM - NIGHT
Liz tries to calm her, but Jamie is spinning out of control. 
Liz takes the hypodermic needle from her bag and inserts it 
into the drip.
JAMIE
When you realize what you've done, 
it will be too late ... too late. 
EXT. E.R. - ENTRANCE - NIGHT
Down the driveway, there’s a taxi parked in the dark with its 
headlights off. Jimbo and Sam are in the back seat. 
An ambulance pulls up at the entrance. The orderly wheels 
Jamie out the emergency doors, with Liz following behind. 
Emery Wells steps out of a black Mercedes limo, parked in the 
NO PARKING zone in front of the ambulance. His coat collar is 
turned up, concealing part of his face.82."
"83.INT. TAXI - NIGHT
SAM
That’s Liz!
He instinctively reaches for the door handle, but Jimbo grabs 
his arm.
JIMBO
Not so fast.
EXT. E.R. - ENTRANCE - NIGHT
The AMBULANCE DRIVER and orderly hoist Jamie’s gurney into 
the back of the ambulance. 
Liz gets into the limo with Wells. They take off ahead of the 
ambulance, which follows, past the taxi, on the way out. 
Jimbo lowers the brim of his hat, and slinks down.
INT./EXT. TAXI - (DRIVING) - NIGHT
JIMBO
Shit!
He leans over to speak to the driver through the glass 
partition.
JIMBO(CONT'D)
Stay on them. Out of sight.
The driver pulls out a safe distance and follows.
JIMBO(CONT'D)
Tell me everything you know about 
your girlfriend.
SAM
I’d hardly call her a “girlfriend.” 
JIMBO
I don’t give a damn what you call 
her. What’s her back story?
SAM
I’m sure you know more about her 
than I do. What the hell gives?
JIMBO
I know what I’ve been told, but 
you’ve got hands-on experience. 
Think. You never saw her before - 
back in Houston, maybe? 83."
"84.SAM
No. She flew in from London, far as 
I know, straight here.
JIMBO
Did she ever talk about how she got 
this gig?
SAM
Supposedly, she was recruited from 
Oxford - top of her class. 
JIMBO
Where’s your phone?
Sam hands over the phone. Jimbo takes off the casing, removes 
the battery and slips it back into Sam’s pocket.
JIMBO(CONT'D)
She’s an agent. Not sure what side. 
Probably Chinese.
Sam laughs, incredulous.
SAM
Get out!
JIMBO
You been screwin’ the wrong babe, 
Sammy boy.
EXT. VANCOUVER - PSYCHIATRIC FACILITY - NIGHT
The ambulance takes a left turn into a driveway. A sign 
reads: VANCOUVER GENERAL - PSYCHIATRIC FACILITY.
INT. TAXI (DRIVING) - NIGHT
JIMBO
(to driver)
The Crow’s Nest. Fast.
The driver steps on it. He pulls up at the Crow’s Nest. Jimbo 
slips the money through the tray and they get out. 
EXT. VANCOUVER - PIER - CROW’S NEST - ENTRANCE - NIGHT
A COUPLE OF ROWDY DRUNKS coming from the bar greet Jimbo as 
he and Sam approach. They walk on down the road, arguing 
incoherently.
Sam and Jimbo stop in the middle of the walkway.84."
"85.JIMBO
Listen up. I'm not who I appear to 
be either. I’m government. U.S 
Government. Covert operations. 
The wind picks up. Jimbo raises his collar.
SAM
Fuck, Jimbo, what kind of crazy are 
you giving me here? 
JIMBO
You’re gonna need a couple of 
straight shots for this.
He pulls open the door to the Crow’s Nest, and they walk in.
JIMBO(CONT'D)
And The Deepwater isn’t about oil. 
It’s our cover. We know there are 
underwater alien colonies off the 
Coast and we’ve been trying to open 
communication for decades. You can 
bet we’re not the only ones. Those 
were motherships you caught on the 
radar screen. 
SAM
Are you shitting me?
JIMBO
I should have known about Liz, 
though. Looks like she answers to a 
higher authority - higher up than 
even Mat. Probably a spy for the 
CCP.
INT. CROW’S NEST - NIGHT
The seedy bar is half-filled with drunken sailors. You can 
almost smell the stench of smoke and old sweat. They take a 
dirty corner table filled with empty beer bottles and a half 
basket of stale popcorn. 
SAM
You’re trying to tell me Mat 
Anderson’s a government agent? 
JIMBO
I served under him in 'Nam. Let’s 
leave it there for now. 
Jimbo walks up to the bar. He throws down a twenty-dollar 
bill.85."
"86.JIMBO(CONT'D)
Hey dog! Set me up a couple of 
brewskies, two shots of your 
strongest scotch and the rest in 
quarters.
The BARTENDER pours two beers from the tap and slides them 
across the bar, with a pile of quarters. Jimbo scoops them 
into his pocket and carries the drinks over to the table.
JIMBO(CONT'D)
Bottoms up!
They drink the shots in one gulp. Jimbo looks around, 
furtively, to make sure no one is listening.
JIMBO(CONT'D)
We’ve identified activity in the 
deep down, but anytime we get 
close, it just disappears. I always 
believed the mission was to open 
contact with whatever life forms 
are down there - but it’s not. 
Jamie saw through it. She saw it 
all. They want to blow the shit out 
of those colonies and keep the 
human race in the dark about what’s 
really going down on this planet 
for another hundred years. Jamie 
knows about that, and everything 
else they’re doing to fuck us up. 
She saw it, or she heard it, or 
some shit. I’ll never understand 
how her brain works. 
Sam runs his hand nervously through his hair and takes 
another gulp of beer.
SAM
(sarcastically)
So, let me get this. You’re a 
government agent, Mat’s your boss, 
Liz is working for the commies, but 
you didn’t know it, and Jamie’s 
talking to whales about hidden 
aliens. Sorry, Captain, but you 
sound like a bad spy novel.
JIMBO
You think I’m playing games here? 
They’ve got Jamie - you get that? 
Whoever grabbed her doesn’t want 
her talking. I’m sure about that. 
And I know damned well what they’ll 
do to her in that psycho prison ... 
before they kill her.86."
"87.SAM
I can call my father. He’ll get her 
out.
JIMBO
Yeah, right. You say three words 
over the phone and Jamie's dead 
meat. This shit’s above top secret. 
You have no idea how dark it gets 
up there.
Jimbo looks around, furtively and swigs the beer.
JIMBO(CONT'D)
We’ve got to grab her before it’s 
too late. I can’t pull this off by 
myself - and you’re all I got. You 
with me? 
SAM
You know it, Captain. Agent - 
whoever you are.
JIMBO
I’m Jimbo, boy. I’m always Jimbo.
Sam is in a semi-state of denial.
JIMBO(CONT'D)
Welcome to upside-down world, son. 
You just said “hello” to a whole 
lot of trouble.
INT. HOTEL SUITE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
Mat and Louise in bed naked, drinking champagne. The sheets 
are in a tangle, half off the bed. The open bottle of 
champagne is on the end table. Two cell phones sit on the 
table - the back covers off. 
Mat places the battery back on one of the phones. It rings 
immediately. He slips on his boxers and takes the phone out 
into the adjoining room.

You have no idea what’s happened to 
your psychic?
MAT ANDERSON
What are you talking about?
DR. WELLS (V.O.)
I should think your captain would 
be the one reporting to you. Not 
me. Have we had a breach?
Mat paces nervously.
MAT ANDERSON
Never. He follows orders and asks 
no questions. Never has. 
DR. WELLS (V.O.)
Where is your captain now?
MAT ANDERSON
They’re still out.
DR. WELLS (V.O.)
Wrong. The Deepwater’s in port.
MAT ANDERSON
What?
DR. WELLS (V.O.)
Find your captain.
Mat nervously slips the battery back into the other cell 
phone. He reads Jimbo’s SMS.
MAT ANDERSON
I didn’t see his message until now.
DR. WELLS (V.O.)
Not a great time to be falling 
asleep on the job, now, is it?
MAT ANDERSON
No, sir, it is not. What’s the 
situation there?
DR. WELLS (V.O.)
Messy. You know how I hate messy 
situations.
MAT ANDERSON
What about Hastings?
DR. WELLS (V.O.)
She’s resting. Talked up a storm 
though. We had to get her to a 
quiet place.88."
"89.MAT ANDERSON
We need her.
DR. WELLS (V.O.
Find your captain and wait for 
instructions. Oh, and get that 
bleached blonde broad out of bed.
Mat stares at the phone. He looks scared. 
Louise calls out.
LOUISE (O.S.)
You coming back to bed, sugar?
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
Mat comes back in and throws on his pants.
MAT ANDERSON
You have to go. I’ve got gators 
biting my ass.
LOUISE 
You’re kicking me out of bed? 
Mat pulls the sheets off her.
MAT ANDERSON
Get dressed. Fast.
She storms into the bathroom.
Mat calls down to the driver, instructing him to wait for her 
at the entrance. Louise comes back out, slips into her 
clothes, and marches out the bedroom door to leave. 
LOUISE
You are one son of a bitch, Mat 
Anderson.
She slams the door loudly behind her. Mat paces the room, 
phone in hand. He tries ringing Jimbo, but there’s no answer.
INT. SHIP IN HARBOR - BOBBY’S CABIN - NIGHT
Bobby’s sound asleep. The phone wakes him with a start. 
MAT ANDERSON (O.S.
Bobby? Where the fuck is Jimbo?89."
"90.BOBBY
Sorry, sir, I... I’m not sure. Last 
I heard, he and Sam were heading 
out to check on Jamie, but I 
crashed early. It was a rough day 
to say the least.

Goddamn it. Track his ass down.
BOBBY
Did you try calling him?
INT. HOTEL SUITE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
MAT ANDERSON
Of course I called him, but he’s 
got his goddamned cell turned off. 
Find his ass. Pronto. Tell him to 
call me no matter what time of 
night it is.
Mat kicks the edge of the bed.
MAT ANDERSON(CONT'D)
And tell him I said to keep that 
freaking phone turned on all night, 
every night.
He hangs up abruptly.
INT. CROW’S NEST - NIGHT
In the midst of the brouhaha at the Crow’s Nest, the phone 
rings. The bartender answers, wiping dry a glass. 
BARTENDER
Crow’s Nest. He’s right here. Yo, 
Jimbo - it’s Bobby.
Jimbo leaps up and grabs the phone.
JIMBO
What’s up?
BOBBY (V.O.)
The boss is furious. You need to 
call him, and I mean immediately. 
And I quote: “turn on your freaking

JIMBO
What did you tell him?90."
"91.BOBBY (V.O.)
That I thought you’d gone to the

She’s good. Doin’ okay. I’m just 
belting back a few to ease the 
rough edges. I’ll call Mat. Where’s

I’d say they’re all nice and warm 
at home. Brady and I are on guard 
out here. Big storm coming.

Call them back in.
BOBBY (V.O.)
You kidding? What gives?
JIMBO
Tell them we’re still in emergency 
mode. Call Doc first. 
BOBBY (V.O.)

Jimbo hangs up. He walks past Sam to the pay phone behind 
their table and calls Mat, faking a drunk.
JIMBO

"92.JIMBO(CONT'D)
I sent it in real time, crisis 
unfolding.
MAT ANDERSON
Never mind. Update me on Jamie H.
JIMBO
Oh, man. Bad accident. She was just 
hanging off the railing, reaching 
out to this big ol’ whale. Fifty of 
them big beauties at least, holding 
us captive out there. I never seen 
that many whales in one place in my 
life.
MAT ANDERSON
(tersely)
We’ll have to talk about that 
later. What about Jamie?
JIMBO
She's in I.C.U. Liz went with the 
medivac. I got the ship in too late 
to visit. Strict rules and all. Liz 
told Sam she was sedated. What a 
scare. 
MAT ANDERSON
You should have reported to me.
JIMBO
Like I said, I did ... in real 
time. Damn rough time out there, 
breaking free. I been through hell 
and I’m tired. 
MAT ANDERSON
You sound drunk. You sure as hell 
don’t need to be hitting the booze 
in the middle of all this.
JIMBO
I never needed a drink more in my 
life.
MAT ANDERSON
Stop drinking, Jim. That’s an 
order.
JIMBO
You got it. I’m grabbing a room. 
Away from the ship, out of the

the morning. Hoowee - it is pouring 
out here. I mean pour...ing!92."
"93.MAT ANDERSON

storm warnings are out for the

report.
JIMBO
Sam? He’s out looking for Liz. They 
got a hot thing goin' on, them two. 
Can’t say that I blame old Sammy 
boy for breaking the rules. Nice

No booze and no ass neither? 
MAT ANDERSON
That’s right. And turn that damn

JIMBO
Well, I will, if I find it.

Where the hell did I put the thing?
Mat laughs nervously, and hangs up. Jimbo looks up at the TV.

"94.INT. CROW’S NEST - STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT
The narrow room is lined in shelves, both sides. There are 
boxes stacked to the ceiling, two empty beer kegs, and a 
trench coat hanging on a hook. 
Jimbo rifles around the top shelf and pulls down a box. He 
extracts two 45 calibers, loads one and sticks it in his 
belt. He throws on the trench coat, and stashes the other gun 
in the pocket.
INT. CROW’S NEST - NIGHT
Jimbo calls over the bartender, and hands back the key. 
JIMBO

The bartender reaches into his pocket, and extracts a key 
from his key ring.

Jimbo takes the key. He rushes over to Sam.

Let’s get out of here.
Jimbo belts down his beer and they bolt for the door.
EXT. CROW’S NEST - REAR ENTRANCE - NIGHT
Teeming rain. There’s a beat up Chevy station wagon parked 
between the garbage bin and a mountain of empty booze bottles

He pulls a ski mask from the coat pocket and hands it to Sam.94."
"95.SAM

He gets out and makes a run for the entrance door, drenched. 
Sam is glued to his gold rolex, counting down the minutes.
INT. PSYCHIATRIC FACILITY - LOBBY - NIGHT
At reception, a NIGHT NURSE and ORDERLY sit watching the

Jimbo walks up to the desk, tracking water through the lobby. 
JIMBO
Evening, ma'am. We've got a pick up 
for a patient. Hastings. Jamie 
Hastings.
NURSE
In this storm? This facility is 
closed for the night.
JIMBO
I hear that. Some crazy weather out 
there - waves washing over the pier 
down at the harbor. Streets 
flooding down there too.
NURSE
And you’re trying to transfer a 
patient - at midnight? 
JIMBO
Yes ma’am. I have a directive to 
bring her back to I.C.U.
NURSE
In writing?
She strains to see outside the door. 
NURSE(CONT'D)
Where’s the ambulance?
JIMBO
They’re all out on emergencies.
She picks up the phone. The orderly stands up, menacingly. 
Jimbo pulls the gun.95."
"96.JIMBO(CONT'D)
Hang up. And sit down, big man. I 
get the woman and I’m on my way. 
Nobody has to get hurt here. 
Sam walks in on cue, gun pointed.
JIMBO(CONT'D)
(to Sam)
Check the supply room for some 
rope. 
He motions to a doorway at the side of reception desk.
Sam disappears into the room and emerges with two 
straightjackets. Jimbo holds the gun on them, while Sam ties 
them in.
JIMBO(CONT'D)
Anyone else on duty?
The nurse shakes her head.
Jimbo waves his gun towards the supply room. They walk 
inside. 
JIMBO(CONT'D)
You make a sound? I’ll kill you. 
You get that? 
They nod. Jimbo grabs Jamie’s chart: ROOM 101. Sam’s got the 
gun out, covering Jimbo’s back. They find Jamie’s room right 
off the lobby and slip inside.
INT. JAMIE’S ROOM - NIGHT
The room is right out of psych ward hell: an overhead bulb, 
hanging from a wire, casts a ghostly shadow on grimy walls. 
Not one window, no air. 
Sam and Jimbo look at each other, appalled to see Jamie’s 
pale and lifeless body tied down to the bed, unconscious. 
Jimbo hands Sam her chart. 
Jimbo undoes the thick leather straps that bind Jamie’s 
wrists and ankles. He detaches the drip, and wraps her in 
blankets. He lifts her over his shoulder. 
JIMBO
Hang on, baby. I’ve got you now.
Sam stashes the file in his jacket and goes to the door 
first, poking his head out. He signals Jimbo and they dash 
for the door: Sam ahead, and Jimbo, behind, carrying Jamie’s 
limp body. We hear muffled cries from the supply room.96."
"97.EXT. PSYCHIATRIC FACILITY - PARKING LOT - NIGHT
They run to the car. Sam pulls off the mask and jumps into 
driver’s seat. Jimbo lays Jamie in the back and gets in, 
placing her head in his lap. 
INT. CAR - (DRIVING) - NIGHT
The car crawls out, back to the main road, pushing through 
flooded streets where the water’s rising, fast and furious.
Sam adjusts the rear view mirror so he can see Jimbo.
JIMBO
Drop us off at the ship, and then 
drive into town. Get a room inland - 
up in the hills. 
SAM
What’s gonna happen to Jamie?
JIMBO
I don’t know. You got money?
SAM
A few bucks, but I’ve got plenty of 
plastic.
Jimbo hands a wad of bills over the seat.
JIMBO
Here, take this just in case. 
Plastic’s better. Use it. You need 
a trail. Make a scene at the hotel 
bar - obnoxious drunk. Be public 
about it. Play the bartender, he 
could be questioned down the road. 
Repeat the story: bad storm, lost 
your phone, your girl. Can you pull 
that off?
Sam tucks the money into his shirt pocket.
SAM
I can do obnoxious.
JIMBO
That’s true Sammy boy - you can do 
that.
Sam turns right. The street is a raging river. A parked car 
rushes past in the current. Others are slipping.
JIMBO(CONT'D)
Damn! Back this sucker up!
Sam throws the car into reverse and pulls them out.97."
"98.SAM
Now what? I don't know any other 
way to get there.
JIMBO
Pull over. 
Jimbo gets out of the back, resting Jamie’s head gently on 
the seat. Sam slides over. Jimbo gets behind the wheel. 
It’s a manic drive through inundated streets to the pier, 
until finally Jimbo guides the car down the flooded driveway, 
where the ship is berthed. 
JIMBO(CONT'D)
Head up to high ground. Ditch the 
car. Find a pay phone and call 911. 
We can't leave those people tied up 
and helpless. Make it short - and 
then walk away fast.
Sam hands him Jamie’s medical chart.
JIMBO(CONT'D)
Call your old man. He’ll get you 
home. Weather the storm, boy. 
Jimbo opens the door, stepping into water up to his calves. 
Sam reaches for the door, but Jimbo stops him. 
JIMBO(CONT'D)
Get out, while you still can. You 
can walk away from this, son. 
SAM
I want to help you.
JIMBO
No, you need to go. You were never 
here, you understand?
Jimbo opens the back door and lifts Jamie’s fragile body over 
his shoulder. He stashes the chart in his pocket and carries 
her, trudging through flood water, over the ramp of the ship.
Sam turns the car around and creeps away, headed for higher 
ground. Through the rear view mirror, he watches Jimbo, with 
Jamie over his shoulder, wading through the flooded pier and 
back over the ramp to the Deepwater.

Good god!
Jimbo takes off his dripping coat and hands it off to 
Alberto. He hands over the chart to Doc. 
JIMBO
We need so much help right now, I’m 
not sure where to start.
Doc removes the wet blankets from Jamie. Bobby grabs some 
wool scarves and jackets from the rack. He covers her.
DOC
Start by getting out of those 
clothes. Dom, get me towels and 
thermal blankets.
JIMBO
Where’s Fin?
DOC
He’s locked up on the bridge. He 
tried to run after you - we just 
couldn’t manage him.

He must be scared to death. Give me 
ten minutes. I need a hot shower. 
Work a miracle, Doc.
Jimbo exits.

wraps her in a blanket. 99."
"100.He takes out a bottle of saline, and hooks her back up to a 
drip. The bottle of saline swings dangerously on its hook.
Jimbo returns in dry clothes, worn out and weary.
JIMBO
How is she?
DOC
She’s pumped full of heavy 
sedatives. Crazy - with a head 
injury? 
JIMBO
She gonna come out of it?
Doc straps Jamie onto the table.
DOC
Don’t know. She sure doesn’t need 
to be on this ship right now, 
that’s for damn sure. 
JIMBO
You’re wrong. This is exactly where 
she needs to be. We’re gonna outrun 
the tsunami. You trust me?
Doc, Brady and Alberto look shocked.

that.

Brady, Alberto, Domenico and Bobby sit around the table, 
anxious. Jimbo stands over them, head of table.
JIMBO
The coast and sea level sections of 
San Francisco are flooded out. A 
tsunami is due to hit the western 
coastline - as far north as Alaska. 
Mike appears from the mess hall and takes a seat.
MIKE
It’s just me. None of my boys came 
back. 
JIMBO

Dom rushes out, without even looking back. Jimbo watches, 
silently, until he’s out the door.
JIMBO(CONT'D)
We all know the danger we’re in - 
there’s no denying it. I’ve seen 
the sea mighty furious, worse than 
this, and I’ve beaten death every

right now is out there, as far from 
shore as we can take her. And god

Fin cries for joy, jumping all over Jimbo, licking his face.
JIMBO(CONT'D)
Okay, okay, I’m here, boy. Lie down 
now, you got to calm down, fella. 
We’ve got a ship to sail.
They take their seats. Fin is hysterical. Jimbo commands him 
to lie down by his side, placing his strong hands on him, 
just like Jamie had. 
With his master’s hands holding him, Fin settles down, his 
paws draped across Jimbo’s feet. 
Jimbo turns on the radio.

hear me? It’s one minute to 
midnight and there’s no escape

annihilated, Jim. We can’t lose

opening communication. I swear. 
That’s why you were brought in.

first contact so we could establish 
their location and persuade them to 
talk to us.

That’s total bullshit. Your mission 
isn’t to talk, Jim, it’s to 
destroy. It’s to wipe out every 
last one of them. In the meantime,

seams. You want to talk to them?

When Jamie was down, she was trying 
to tell me about the colony. She 
could hear them - the whales were 
talking to her! Liz was right 
there, trying to hear. 
The radio crackles like it’s cutting out.
JIMBO(CONT'D)
We call in medivac, and Liz tells 
Doc she's going, no permission 
required. I get us back in, and 
head to the hospital, and what do I 
find? Jamie being taken away in an 
ambulance, while Liz climbs into a 
limo and drives away. Of course I 
follow. The limo and the ambulance 
pull up outside this psychiatric 
facility. And my mind’s racing 
overtime. Why would anybody be 
locking Jamie up in a place like 
that? I'm thinking, who brought 
this babe Liz into the operation, 
anyway? And then, bam! The light 
goes on. This is an agent. Shit, 
man. She's an agent! And now my 
question for you, boss, is: who is 
she working for?
MAT ANDERSON (V.O.)
What the hell are you tryin’ to do 
here, Jimmy boy?
JIMBO
Why was Jamie dragged from the 
hospital half dead? I figure she 
had to be talking. Somewhere 
between dying and being shot up 
with chemicals - she's been in 
communication with that colony. 
They're talking to her. 
MAT ANDERSON (V.O.)
I’m listening.
JIMBO
Sure enough, they're telling her 
that the sonar and the ELFs are so 
bad down there, they can't hold 
physical form. It’s disrupting the 
whole colony.

transmissions.
JIMBO
You hearing me? She has made 
contact. Isn't this why we're out 
here? She's got the word: silence 
the sonar, and they’ll come out.
MAT ANDERSON (V.O.)
Do you know what you're asking me 
to do? We're talking the highest 
level. That will take time.
JIMBO
Mat? San Francisco’s gone. The 
entire West Coast is sinking. Jamie 
says another massive quake is going 
to hit Alaska in a few hours unless 
you can get them to shut these 
towers down. You want me to deliver 
this colony? I can do it. They're 
willing to talk through Jamie. 
She's their Emissary. What a 
mission. 
MAT ANDERSON
I’ll get back to you.
Jimbo switches off all tracking equipment and communication 
systems, isolating the ship.
JIMBO
He wants “coordinates, not 
transmissions?” So, you’re right? 
(shaking his head)
If Mat is that evil, and I’ve never 
seen it? Well, then, none of my 
life has made any sense.
Jamie reaches over and places her trembling hand on his knee. 
Jimbo is distraught, somewhere between disbelief and despair.

Jimbo and Doc gaze out at sea, too stunned to speak. In the 
background, there’s a strange luminescence in the water, 
ahead of the ship. 
Jimbo is first to see the light.
The ocean becomes illuminated. There’s a huge displacement of 
water. Neon lights flash in an enormous circular pattern, ten 
times the size of The Deepwater. A mammoth craft surfaces, 
lighting up the ocean for miles.
Doc turns to look. In a flash, an alien craft shoots out of 
the water, hovers over the ship, and zooms up into the star-
studded sky.
Alberto and Brady come running from the doorway.
