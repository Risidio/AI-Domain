A plate of khichadi. A FORTY YEAR OLD MAN walks with it to - *
A wrought iron sofa. A 10-YEAR OLD BOY sits there. *
The Man puts the plate in front of the Boy.
The Boy looks at the watery, unappetising sludge.
BOY OF TEN
Fer khichadi?
MAN OF FORTY
Toh ke Chowmein banaaun thaare 
liye? Kha le chup chaap.
He pushes the plate towards the Boy - who pushes it back.
The Man looks at the Boy sharply.And again pushes the plate towards him. Again - same result.The Man tries hard to control his anger. Pushes it one more 
time. As the Boy is about to push it back, out of nowhere - 
SLAP! The Man hits the Boy hard, leaving him stunned.
MAN OF FORTY (CONT’D)
Haraamjaade! Thaare vaaste manne 
doosra byaah na kara...
Angry tears appear in the Boy’s eyes. He hits the plate hard, sending it noisily toppling on the ground.
And runs out of the house.The Man goes after him.
EXT. LOWER MIDDLE CLASS LOCALITY - NIGHT 5.1C 5.1C
Out in the lane, the Boy runs. His face - angry, distorted.
The Man chases, shouting - 
MAN OF FORTY
Je tu haath aagya aaj...
And then he notices something and his expression suddenly 
changes. He SCREAMS in panic and concern - 
MAN OF FORTY (CONT’D)
HAATHI RAM!"
"The Boy turns to look. From his right - a car coming right at 
him at high speed.
He stops just in time as the car HONKS its way past him, 
missing him by a whisker.
From behind, the man catches up with him - panting, relieved.The two stand facing each other, trying to catch their 
breath. And then, the Man slaps the boy hard in anger.

FADE IN:
EXT. HATHI RAM'S HOUSE - DAY 5.2 5.2
Early morning. An auto rickshaw comes to a stop outside. A drunk Hathi Ram remains seated, only peeps out to throw a 
forlorn look at his house.
SOUND OVERLAY - Ting Tong! A doorbell rings.
INT. HATHI RAM'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 5.3 5.3
Renu opens the door to see Hathi Ram standing there.
And she’s both relieved and angry to see him.
RENU
Itni late aana thha  toh ek phone *
nahi kar sakte thhe? Mobile bhi off 
kar rakha hai...
HATHI RAM
Sun. Tujhe kuchh bataana hai.
Renu makes a face at the smell that comes out of his mouth.
RENU
Duty hee kar rahe thhe ya kuchh aur?
Hathi Ram quietly goes and sits down on the sofa.
HATHI RAM
Baith na. Bataata hoon sab.
Renu looks at him - surprised at his somber tone. She sits down on the edge of the diwan, a bit concerned by now.Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 2."
"RENU
Kya hua? Sab theek na?
Hathi Ram looks at her. And takes a deep breath.
HATHI RAM
Wo... thaane mein... thodi 
gadbad...
Just then - Sid walks in, dressed for school.
Hathi Ram stops. Sid hands him a letter.
SID
School waalon ne diya hai.
As Hathi Ram opens to read it - 
RENU
Koi carrier counselling rakh rahe *
hain. Alag alag profession waale 
parents ko bula rahe hain, bachchon ke saath interact karne ke liye. Pata hai poori class ke parents mein tumhi ek police waale ho?
As Hathi Ram stares at the letter - 
SID
Sign kar do ki aap ko copy dikha di hai maine. 
(murmurs; almost hoping)
Aana zaroori nahi hai.
Their eyes meet. Hathi Ram nods. Then signs it.
RENU
Achcha kya bol rahe thhe bataao.
Hathi Ram feels upon him - the eyes of the two of them.
A long beat. And then - he shakes his head.
HATHI RAM
Nahi, kuchh nahi. Aise hee. 
(changes the topic)
Ek chai pilaayegi?
As Renu hurries to the kitchen, Hathi Ram sits there 
brooding.Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 3."
"INT. JAMUNA PAAR POLICE STATION - EVIDENCE ROOM - DAY 5.4 5.4
There is urgency and discipline in the air. CBI Office SUNIL *
GAUTAM sips tea as he oversees TWO JUNIOR CBI OFFICERS neatly *
bagging and tagging the evidence in transparent ziplocks - *
Two Guns, Kabir’s wooden chicks, knife and certificate, *
Cheeni’s crumpled dollars. *
Ansari reads out the entries, as the Evidence Room In-charge *
ticks items off a list. *
INT. JAMUNA PAAR POLICE STATION - SHO’S CABIN - DAY 5.4A 5.4A*
DCP Bhagat and the female CBI officer RACHNA DWIVEDI sit *
chatting while Virk stands in attention nearby. *
Ansari and Sunil Gautam walk in. Ansari hands over the list *
to DCP Bhagat who glances at it cursorily - *
ANSARI
Ho gaya sir. *
DCP BHAGAT *
Good. Wo chaaron ke statements bhi -
ANSARI
Haan sir, wo bhi de diye.
Bhagat nods. And hands over the list to Dwivedi with a smile - *
DCP BHAGAT *
Ye dekho Dwivedi saab, Dilli Police 
ki efficiency. Par media waalon ko 
toh bas galtiyaan dikhti hain 
hamaari...
Dwivedi laughs.
DWIVEDI
Yehi hota hai Bhagat. Galti ek ki 
hoti hai, bill poore department pe 
fat-ta hai.
DCP BHAGAT *
Aap ko aur kisi bhi help ya 
information ki zaroorat padey - 
Ansari is your man. One of our brightest. UPSC mains clear kiya hai ladke ne...
Dwivedi looks at Ansari with a new sense of respect. And instinctively looks at his name tag.
DWIVEDI
Good. All the best. 
(to Bhagat)
(MORE)Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 4."
"Inki community se aajkal kaafi aa 
rahe hain, nahi? Very good. Isse apne aap hee community ki image change ho jaayegi, dekhna tum.
It makes Ansari cringe, but he manages an awkward smile.
EXT. JAMUNA PAAR POLICE STATION - TEA STALL - DAY 5.5 5.5
Hathi Ram, in civvies, rides in on his Hero Honda bike. Parks 
it outside.
As he walks towards the station, he sees the CBI team walk 
out, followed by Ansari, Bhagat and Virk.
Fuck. He doesn’t want to face the circus now. He turns around 
instinctively and walks to -
THE TEA STALL
: From there, he sees - Ansari shaking hands 
with DCP Bhagat and the CBI officers. *
A tinge of jealousy comes upon Hathi Ram. The CHAIWALA looks at him with sympathy.
CHAIWALA
Aap ke saath bahot galat hua saab.
Hathi Ram turns to glare at him.
HATHI RAM
Tu chai bana na bhonsadi ke.
And then he notices - The four accused are brought out, tied 
in pairs to a rope - Cheeni and Kabir, Chaaku and Tyagi.
As they are taken to the parked SUVs, Cheeni looks towards 
the tea stall.
For a moment Hathi Ram thinks Cheeni is looking at him, but 
then he realizes - it’s not him. It’s someone behind him.
He follows Cheeni’s gaze and sees - The Dark Guy we saw 
earlier. He seems to be staring back at her intently. *
Just then - the Dark Guy notices Hathi Ram looking at him. 
An intrigued Hathi Ram turns back one more time to look at *
Cheeni. And this time when he turns back to the Dark Guy, he *
has disappeared from there. *
INT. JAMUNA PAAR POLICE STATION - DAY 5.6 5.6*
The desk with the attendance register. As Hathi Ram walks up 
to it and signs the register - DWIVEDI (CONT'D)Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 5."
"The CONSTABLE at the desk gets up to salute him. Then looks 
at him with sorry eyes.
HATHI RAM
Teranhvi waali shakal kyun bana rakhi hai? Suspend hua hoon, maraa nahi hoon...
Hathi Ram hears - laughter. He looks in the direction. It’s Virk and Ansari, stepping out into the corridor. *
Hathi Ram is about to walk away when - 
SHO VIRK *
Chaudhari!
Hathi Ram stops in his steps. And lets out a silent groan.
As he slowly turns, Virk and Ansari walk up to him. Ansari *
salutes. *
ANSARI *
Good morning, sir! Aap kab aaye? *
HATHI RAM *
Abhi. *
Awkward silence. *
SHO VIRK *
Yaar kal jo bhi hua... dekh, yeh *
enquiry, suspension ye sab apni *
jagah hai, par hum puraane dost *
hain... *
(beat) *
Kuch bhi madad chahiye ho toh *
bataana. *
Hathi Ram just stares at him for a few moments, almost *
unnerving Virk. And then he turns around and storms out. *
Ansari watches him go - a little concerned. *
Note: Scene 5.6 and earlier Scene 5.7 have been combined into 
*
the same location and earlier scene 5.7 has been deleted. *
OMITTED 5.7 5.7*
EXT. JAMUNA PAAR POLICE STATION - DAY 5.8 5.8
Hathi Ram is still fuming as he reaches up to his bike. He 
kick starts it in anger. *
HATHI RAM
Madad karega bhenchod.Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 6."
"He turns it around and is about to leave when Ansari appears. *
ANSARI
Sir. Shaam ko adde pe milein? Meri 
party...
Hathi Ram looks at him.
HATHI RAM
Mere suspend hone ki khushi mein?
Uh-oh. Ansari realises he chose the wrong words.
ANSARI
Sorry sir, mera wo matlab -
HATHI RAM
Toh kya matlab thha? Ki bechaara depressed hai, chalo isko baahar le jaate hain, thodi madad ho jaayegi...
Ansari’s taken aback. And a little offended too. *
ANSARI
Sir aap galat samajh -
HATHI RAM
Dekh, jab mera afsar ban ke aayega na, toh jo bolega wo jhelunga. Par uske pehle ye hamdardi dikhaane ka naatak kiya na, toh uski batti banaa ke peechhe ghused doonga tere. Samjha?
With that, Hathi Ram jumps on to his bike. And rides away.
Ansari remains standing there - Hurt. Very hurt.We STAY ON Hathi Ram’s frustrated face as he rides away. And 
with it, a MONTAGE kicks in.

A couple of officers flip out their phones and record videos 
of the search.
They don’t seem to be finding anything important until -

Sunil Gautam rushes in the direction. The Officer shines a 
torch into an overhead loft.

ground.
He opens the bag. And something large stares out at them.Lo and behold! It’s an AK-56, along with two more Glocks.Sunil Gautam’s eyes spot something else too. Looks like some 
literature in Urdu and Arabic. 
As he looks through the books and pages, he spots - a 
passport. He takes it out with his gloved hands and opens it. *A photo of Kabir inside. *
And as he shuts it, we see the cover. It’s a passport of the *

Bhagat tries to say something. But Hathi Ram just won’t let him as he continues to talk, with increasing desperation.
HATHI RAM (CONT’D)
Aur... aur bhi leads hain hamaare paas. Jaise ki uss Tyagi ka Chitrakoot connection. Wo Gwala Bhai,  wo Masterji, in ka Sanjeev Mehra se kya link hai ye pata lagaa rahe thhe sir. 
(almost manic)

His voice trails off as he realizes how bizarre he sounds.
A beat. He looks at DCP Bhagat who’s looking at him with *
compassion.
DCP BHAGAT *
Meditation karte ho? Dhyaan 
vagairah?
HATHI RAM
Jee sir? Nahi, aisa toh kuchh... 
Bhagat puts a kind hand over his shoulder.
DCP BHAGAT *
Bahut zaroori hai hum logon ke liye. Shuru karna chaahoge? Neeche wahi program hai.

"YOUNG FEMALE VET
She’s fine. She’s going to be a 
mother.
Dolly beams a smile. And gently calms down the nervous bitch.
YOUNG FEMALE VET (CONT’D)
It’s really nice of you to be taking care of her.
Dolly looks affectionately at the dog.
DOLLY
I so want to adopt her.
YOUNG FEMALE VET
Then? Koi problem hai?
DOLLY
(sighs)
My husband... he’s allergic to the hair.
The Vet nods in sympathy.
Just then, Dolly’s phone rings. Dolly excuses herself and 
answers.
DOLLY (CONT’D)
Hello?
SUNIL GAUTAM (O.S.)
(filtered; off the phone)
Hello Ma’m, this is Sunil Gautam from the CBI. We’ve been trying to get in touch with your husband. Par unka phone switch off aa raha hai.
DOLLY
Oh! Aapne office mein try kiya? Main number deti - 
SUNIL GAUTAM (O.S.)
(tired)
Ma’am, wo office mein nahi hain. Wahin se aap ke ghar ka number mila, aur aap ki maid se aap ka...
Dolly seems concerned now.
DOLLY
Oh! I’ll try to reach him -
SUNIL GAUTAM (O.S.)
Not to worry, Ma’am. I just took a chance ki shaayad aap log saath hon. Main unhe ek SMS kar deta hoon. Sorry to bother you.14."
"The line gets disconnected. Dolly stares at the phone - 
worried.
The Vet looks at her.
YOUNG FEMALE VET
All okay?
Dolly mumbles something -
DOLLY
Yeah... my husband...
She quickly tries out Sanjeev’s number. For sure, it says 
‘switched off’.
Dolly starts to stress out. She tries another number.Soon, a voice comes.
SHADOW ONE (O.S.)
Jee Ma’am?

The Two Shadows hang by the car, smoking a cigarette.
DOLLY
Dharmender, sab theek hai na? Aap 
Sanjeev ke saath ho na?
SHADOW ONE
Jee ma’am. Hum sir ke saath hee 
hain.
DOLLY (O.S.)
Sanjeev ka phone kyun off hai? Aur ho kahaan aap log?
Shadow One looks at his partner - awkward.
SHADOW ONE
Ma’am wo... hum... office mein hee hain... sir shaayad meeting mein -
DOLLY
(getting worked up)
Nahi! Unhone kahaa office mein toh nahi ho. Theek theek bataao kahaan ho.
Shadow One looks up at the building he’s standing under.
A window on the 3rd floor - lit in the light of a lamp.15."
"INT. SARA’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT 5.21 5.21
This is where Sanjeev is. He lies on the bed next to Sara, 
sharing a post-coital cigarette.
Sara seems lost in her thoughts.
SARA
There was something sad about her.
SANJEEV
Huh?
SARA
Your wife. How long has it been... 
with all the anxiety stuff?
Sanjeev goes a bit pensive at that.
SANJEEV
A few years now. Seems like forever...
SARA
And what was she like -
Sanjeev cuts her and gets up. *
SANJEEV *
Can we talk about something else?
Sara looks at him. Nods. Then passes him the cigarette.
SARA
We should do an in-depth on those four guys.
SANJEEV
Like on the police fuck ups? The botched up investigation...?
SARA
No, that’s being covered enough. A human story. Un chaaron ke baare 
mein. Who they really are. Where they grew up. What motivates them to do this kind of work.
She stops as she sees Sanjeev looking at her.
SARA (CONT’D)
What?
SANJEEV
(smirks)
We liberals are such a cliche. All we need for a “human story” is a Muslim criminal. 
(MORE)Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 16."
"Or an LGBT character. Aur yehaan 
toh dono hain.
Sara looks him in the eye.
SARA
Is that why you were rubbing noses 
with that Kapoor? To mutate your liberal genes?
Sanjeev evades Sara’s eyes and gets busy with his phone, switching the DND mode off.
SANJEEV
Bola na yaar. Bathroom mein takra 
gaya tha. Kya karta?
Just then, his phone rings. Almost relieved - Sanjeev walks away to the window, and answers his phone.
SANJEEV (CONT’D)
Hello?
He listens on, with rising interest. Then cuts the phone and turns to look at Sara.
SANJEEV (CONT’D)

INT. HATHI RAM'S HOUSE - NIGHT 5.23 5.23
Late evening. Hathi Ram, drunk, manages to open the door and 
walk into the living room.
Only to see - couple of RENU’S NEIGHBOURHOOD FRIENDS sitting 
there with her. Sparkling water glasses on the table.
The laughter in the room dies down as they look at Hathi 
Ram’s dishevelled state - the beard, the shirt, the smell.
Hathi Ram quietly goes inside. *SANJEEV (CONT'D)
Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 17."
"Renu watches him go. Something on her mind.
RENU’S FRIEND
Achcha Renu hum chalte hain...
A conscious Renu tries to sound casual -
RENU
Bhabhi order nahi diya aapne...
RENU’S FRIEND
Wo kya hai na Renu, mere husband ko 
sodey se badi gas hoti hai. Saara din thoon-thaan lagi rahegi...
She laughs awkwardly. Disappointment on Renu’s face.
INT. HATHI RAM'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT 5.24 5.24

back to her. Without turning back -

Ek bhi nahi bika na ab tak? Ab toh maan le tera bhai ek number ka fraud -
RENU
(cuts him)
Khaana lagaa doon?
HATHI RAM
Nahi. Thaane mein kuchh kha liya tha.
Renu looks at him for a long time. Considers. Then says it -
RENU
Mujhe pata hai tum suspend ho gaye 
ho.
Silence in the room.
A long beat. And then Hathi Ram slowly turns towards her. 
Conscious. Guilty.
RENU (CONT’D)
Kaam se aate hue jitti bhi der ho *
jaaye, khaana ghar pe hee khaate *
thhe, mere haath ka... *
Their eyes meet for a long moment, before Hathi Ram looks *
away. *Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 18."

Shefali hans rahi hogi mujhpe.
Hathi Ram still has no answer to this. Renu walks out.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT 5.25 5.25
Dolly sits at a table, alone, sipping a Cold Coffee.
She looks dazed as she twirls the coffee with a straw, absent-
mindedly.
She feels something and looks up.A YOUNG MAN is eyeing her. He’s kinda cute.When caught, he smiles at her - awkward.Dolly doesn’t smile back. Not even a nod. She just continues 
to look at him with a deadpan face.
It makes the Young Man uncomfortable. The smile disappears 
from his face as he looks away.
A few moments later, he glances back at her.Dolly’s still staring at him.
EXT. DELHI STREET - DOLLY’S CAR - NIGHT 5.26 5.26
A quiet, dimly lit lane. The parked car. Dolly is at the 
wheel. The Cute Young Man, next to her.
Awkward silence in the air. Finally -
CUTE YOUNG MAN
I am Varun.
Dolly looks at him, but doesn’t say anything.
CUTE YOUNG MAN (CONT’D)
Should we, er, go somewhere?
Dolly shakes her head.Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 19."
"The Man throws a look around. Then puts his hand on her knee. 
Nothing aggressive, but clearly suggestive.
Dolly’s uncomfortable - but doesn’t remove it.Encouraged, the hand slowly begins to slide up her thigh.Dolly’s body stiffens up as she holds on tight to the

With him - A couple of the neighbourhood fanboys we’ve seen 
earlier.
Sid’s mighty impressed with the car.
SID

Raju Bhaiyya takes off his shades like he has seen them do in the movies.

Mr. Chaudhari! Stop! You can’t do 
this here! Mr. Chaudhari!
Ansari somehow pulls Hathi Ram back from Sid. Hathi Ram fumes for a few moments glaring at his son.

The Peon opens the drawer, picks the gun as if it were a dead

Please ask him where he got this thing from. He refuses to say anything to us.
Hathi Ram looks at Sid. And then lies - 
HATHI RAM
Sorry madam. This my service gun. By mistake taken by son.
Ansari steals a glance at Hathi Ram, who feels his gaze.
The Principal shakes her head in disbelief.
PRINCIPAL
Aap itne careless kaise ho sakte

HATHI RAM

I mean, on an undercover mission. He’s tracking someone the Delhi Police is after. And his being drunk is a part of the act. I’d have told you more, but it’s strictly “need to know” basis.
Hathi Ram glances at Ansari at the use of that phrase.
PRINCIPAL
Oh! But that’s got nothing to do with the gun.
ANSARI
Ma’am, I apologize on his behalf. I assure you it won’t happen again.
PRINCIPAL
But I cannot - look, there are rules -

Sanjeev smiles.

That’s exactly what they want. They want me to run with it.
Sara looks at him with surprise as they reach the elevators.
SANJEEV (CONT’D)
Think about it. If the news comes from me first, what signal does it send out? That even though I’ve been a vocal critic of the government in the past, they’re still looking out for me. They become the heroes. A government to vote for.

apna confession likha hai.
A surprised Hathi Ram fidgets in his chair at the disclosure - *
Sara turns to look at him. And this time, she has figured who he is.
SARA
Excuse me. Aap is case ke incharge 
thhe na...?
She offers her hand -
SARA (CONT’D)
Sara Matthews. News Now.
A wary Hathi Ram tries to ignore her.
HATHI RAM
Jee sorry, mujhe koi baat nahi 
karni.
SARA
(smiles)
Ghabraiye mat. Main ye story officially pursue nahi kar rahi. 
Bas kuchh curiosity thhi...
Hathi Ram looks at her with bitterness - 
HATHI RAM
Jaane do, Madam. Bahot buri cheej 
hoti hai ye curiosty. Suspend karwa 
diya mujhe isne...
He turns back towards the stage, signalling an end to the conversation.Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 39."
"DWIVEDI
Delhi aane ke baad ye chaar hafte 
Batla House ke ek flat mein ruke jo 
inhone kiraaye pe liya thha Girja 
Gurung ke naam par.
Pictures of the aparment and the evidence recovered there 
flashes on the projector.
DWIVEDI (CONT’D)
Aakhiri ke chaar dino mein inhone 
ek hotel mein do kamre book kiye, target ke paas rehne ke liye. Par 
ab bhi arms aur ammunition safety ke liye flat pe hee rakhe the. Bees *
February ki subah inhone target ko *
terminate karne ka plan banaaya aur 
arms uthaane ke iraade se apne flat 
ki taraf jaa rahe thhe jab Delhi 
Police ne inhe ek anonymous tip pe 
arrest kiya. Us Flat se hamein inke 
finger prints mile hain aur kuch 
hathiyaar bhi baramad hue hain 
jisme ek AK-56 rifle, do Glock G20 
pistols aur sau se zyaada live ammunition hai.
Virk whispers something to Ansari.
DWIVEDI (CONT’D)
Kabir M ke Pakistani passport ke  alaawa iske paas se kuchh Jihadi 
literature bhi mila hai.
On the projector
: Kabir’s passport. And a couple of books in 
Urdu.
Ansari’s expression changes as he watches these photographs. 
Virk looks at him, and then at the screen - not quite understanding.
DWIVEDI (CONT’D)
On the basis of all this evidence and investigation, CBI is filing its chargesheet today against the four accused. We would like to thank Delhi Police for their support and thorough investigation, especially DCP Bhagat from Delhi *
Police Intelligence and SHO Virk, Outer Jumna Paar Police Station.
A beaming Virk turns to say something to Ansari, but Ansari cuts him - 
ANSARI
Sir, aata hoon. Ek phone aa raha *
hai... Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 40."
"Virk watches him go, not quite sure what’s going on.
Meanwhile on the stage :
DWIVEDI
We’ll now take your questions.
Journalists clamour, shouting their questions and raising 
their hands in desperation.
Hathi Ram spots Ansari leaving. Their eyes meet. Ansari 
quietly signals to Hathi Ram - ‘follow me’.
Sara notices it. And watches as Hathi Ram quietly gets up and 
follows Ansari - 
While a JOURNO asks a rather important question to Dwivedi -
JOURNO AT CONFERENCE
Sir agle maheene Siri Fort mein jo 
Rahat Fateh Ali Khan ka concert 
hone wala hai, aapko lagta hai is 
case se uspe koi fark padega?
Sara’s about to get up too. When her eyes go to - Hathi Ram’s 
little notebook lying on the ground. 
She picks it up and rushes towards the exit -But Hathi Ram’s gone.
EXT. CBI OFFICE - STAIRCASE - DAY 5.51 5.51*
Ansari paces up and down when - Hathi Ram catches up to him.
HATHI RAM
Toh teri curiosty bhi jaag gayi 
bhai? Ki Tariq ka suicide note uske ghar pe kaise mil sakta hai?
Ansari looks at him.
HATHI RAM (CONT’D)
Usey pata thha humne ghar pe raid ki hai, uske Chacha ko bhi utha ke laaye the. Phir bhi wo ghar gaya, suicide note likhne. Uske baad kisi ne uska gala dabaaya, aur fir wo jaa ke Seelampur Barrage mein kood gaya...? 
ANSARI
Main kuchh aur soch raha hoon, sir.
It’s Hathi Ram’s turn to look at him.Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 41."
"ANSARI (CONT’D)
Us flat se jo jihadi kitaabein mili 
hain, uspe Kabir ka naam likha tha.
HATHI RAM
Haan toh?
ANSARI
Naam urdu mein likha tha Sir. Kabir ko urdu nahi aati.
Hathi Ram is stunned. The two stand there - unsure what to do now. 
And we PULL UP, UP and AWAY from them.
FADE OUT
ROLL END CREDITS *42."
