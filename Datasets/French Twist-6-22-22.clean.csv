"EXT. THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA - DAWN
We are behind the weathered sail of a tiny fishing boat, a 
leathery fisherman leaning on the tiller. The boat’s 
name,”Mer du Franchotte” hand lettered across the stern. In 
the distance, the pastoral hills of Nice.
AN OMINOUS HUMMING APPROACHES, rapidly building louder as it 
bears down on the tiny boat, quickly GROWING INTO THE ROAR OF 
MASSIVE TURBINES. A SHADOW LOOMS OVER THE BOAT.
The fisherman looks up to see: A MASSIVE MEGAYACHT - IT 
THUNDERS PAST PRACTICALLY CAPSIZING THE TINY BOAT IN ITS 
WAKE! The fisherman tries to hang on as all around him a 
FLOTILLA OF MEGAYACHTS OBLITERATES THE SUNLIGHT BEARING DOWN 
ON CANNES. WE HEAR THE SCREECHING OF TIRES AS:
EXT. NICE AIRPORT - SAME TIME
PRIVATE JETS LAND ON THE NICE RUNWAYS, one after another. The 
airport looks like a Black Friday parking lot jammed with 
Gulfstreams and Bombardiers.
CANNES - MORNING
HORDES OF HOLLYWOOD LOCUST DESCEND ON THE TOWN FOR THEIR 
ANNUAL GLAMFEST. LIMOS DISGORGE PRODUCERS, ACTORS, 
BILLIONAIRES, FASHION ICONS AND OVERDRESSED CELEBRITIES AS 
THE PAPARAZZI CLICK AWAY!
EXT. VILLA - DAY 
A once elegant haven now in need of fresh paint but resplendent 
with blossoming flowers and fruit trees. There are little nooks 
and benches around the terraced property. A circular drive with 
weeds growing between the pavers leads to a dilapidated garage.
INT. VILLA/FOYER - DAY
Two people stare at a large abstract painting. One is MIMI 
FRANCHOTTE, the housekeeper. Mimi’s a bit prim. Never married. 
Could look nice, if somebody showed her how to do it. With her 
is BLINKY PALERMO, a local art dealer, who speaks English like 
Chico Marx.
BLINKY
It’s one of his best, ‘ey?
MIMI
(all business)
‘ow much you will give us?"
"2.BLINKY
You know if you wait for this guy to 
die, it’ll be worth ten, maybe a 
hundred times...
MIMI
The bank won’t wait.
BLINKY
Okay, tell Alex, I’ll give him five 
thousand for it.
MIMI
Five thousand? You Belgian...
(begins cursing in French)
You’ll give us ten!
BLINKY
Seven-five...
MIMI
Oui. But no interest for three months. 
Because ‘e’s going to get work very 
soon.
BLINKY
(clearly afraid of her)
Yes, yes, Mimi. Of course he will.
She notices the time.
MIMI
Ah, the time! Take the painting. 
Go! Go! And tell my sister I’ll be 
over on Saturday.
Blinky nods dutifully and hurries to remove the painting. 
Mimi runs to the stairs; calls out.
MIMI
Alex! It’s time to get ready!
She shoos away Blinky who scurries out with the canvas.
CUT TO:
INT. MASTER BATHROOM - MORNING
A large, once elegant en-suite, with grand mirror running the 
length of the marble counter which houses two sinks. Mimi 
lays out barber shears, combs, hair dyes and gels.
A middle aged man with puffy eyes, salt and pepper beard, and 
long, unruly greying hair stares in the mirror. IN SPITE OF 
THE MILEAGE HE’S STILL QUITE HANDSOME. 2."
"3.HE KEEPS STARING INTO EYES THAT REVEAL LAYERS OF COMPLEXITY: 
CYNICISM WITHOUT BITTERNESS, WORLD WEARY HUMOR, AND SAVAGE 
INTELLIGENCE. This is ALEX LOMBARD. A once successful 
screenwriter and ladies man. A has-been.
Alex takes an eyebrow pencil and draws on the mirror. With 
artist’s flourishes he paints black eyebrows, and beautiful 
black ringlets on the glass, giving him a kind of Prince 
meets Groucho Marx look. 
He sits back in his chair, contemplating this image.
ALEX
Hmm.
He leans forward, smudges out the ringlets with his pinky and 
draws the classic pompadour. He sits back again, stares for a 
moment, nods, satisfied.
ALEX
That’s the look, Mimi. Tight sides, 
a little Elvis at the top. Let’s 
start with the eyebrows. No wiry 
upcurls. We may have to dye them.
She takes the comb and scissors and begins trimming. Was she 
trained in beauty school or is this just years of practice 
cutting Alex’s hair?
MIMI
Are you ready for all this, Alex?
ALEX
Of course. All I have to do is be 
the adult in the room. These are 
nothing more than spoiled children.
CUT TO:
INT. MAJESTIC HOTEL - A PAIR OF PIFERI VEGAN STILETTOS
CLICK across the lobby. Move up from the stilettos, up the 
thigh gap, sheathed in Gevinchy, past a bare navel of honeyed 
skin to wrists wrapped in Chopard, cradling a pekinese with 
Chopard collar sitting in a Hermes bag, and we move up to the 
perfect 19-year-old face of NITA. The missing Kardashian. The 
elevator doors are held for her.
ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN - THREE FLOORS LATER
Nita emerges trailed by ANTONIO, Euro producer in his 
sixties, yapping in French on his cellphone, and two bellman 
pushing carts laden with suitcases. The first bellman holds 
the door open and they enter:3."
"4.INT. JUNIOR SUITE - CONTINUOUS
A tasty suite overlooking the Croisette. Pretty nice. Nita’s 
frown says she is not pleased.
NITA
(Romanian accent)
This is horrible.
Antonio picks up on her displeasure.
ANTONIO
(into phone)
Let me call you right back, Marco.
He clicks off. Stares into her pouting face.
INT. PENTHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
The top floor suite. Massive. The yachts filling the harbor 
below are so close you can just about pee on to them. This is 
as good as it gets. Nita’s pleased. Antonio tips the bellmen. 
Antonio slumps onto the couch with an exhausted GROAN. Drops 
his European facade.
ANTONIO
(Eastend accent)
Pwaw, fuck. I don’t know how I do this 
every year. Pour us a drink, luv.
Nita grabs a bottle of Veuve Clicquot from the minibar.
INT. ALEX’S BATHROOM  
Mimi snips and Alex’s long grey locks tumble away.
ALEX
Mimi, it’s all a game of heat.
MIMI
‘eat?
ALEX
Heat. That’s what everybody craves. 
Heat.
MIMI
‘eat.
ALEX
How much heat you have. Or how much is 
coming your way. Or how fast it is 
leaving you.4."
"(MORE)5.MIMI
And ‘ow much ‘eat do you ‘ave?
ALEX
None. So I must create a little 
romance.
MIMI
Romance?
ALEX
Exactly. A little Michael Caine on the 
Riviera. Very romantic. Very cool. In 
the absence of heat, one must be the 
epitome of cool. Total and absolute 
cool.
MIMI
I see. So if you ‘ave no ‘eat, you 
must be very very cold.
ALEX
Well, no, you don’t want to be cold. 
That’s bad. But if you can’t be hot, 
it’s good to be very cool.
MIMI
I am confused. Premier le chaud! Et 
puis le froid! I don’t want to talk 
about the weather anymore.
INT. PURPLE SUITE - DAY
GRETCHEN SCHOTZ, a hard, pretty woman with a predatory mouth and 
amazingly taut body, yaks on the cellphone as a bellman 
struggles with her bags. Gretchen’s sharply bobbed hair and 
flamboyant style would intimidate Anna Wintour. This is a 
hellbitch on wheels. Do not fuck with Gretchen. Ever. Her second 
cellphone buzzes.
GRETCHEN
Slide my two-fifteen to three and fit 
Alistair in that slot.
She rummages through her Chanel bag and several cellphones 
tumble out on to the floor. She shoots the bellman a look.
He nervously scrambles to gather up the spilled mobile phones 
as she checks the caller ID, rolls her eyes and answers.
GRETCHEN
Dimitri, I know you’re not bringing 
me anymore problems. Because I told 
you, just fix it. Don’t tell me 
what’s wrong. I just want to know 
you’ve fixed it. Now, tell me... 
(MORE)5."
"GRETCHEN (cont’d)6.Stop, that sounds like a problem. 
Listen carefully. Only call me with 
happy news. Everything is fixed and 
my world is happy. That’s all.
She clicks off and returns to her other cellphone.
GRETCHEN
Did you hear that? If he was mine 
to fire, he’d have been gone like 
last year. Anyway, have room 
service send up a mesclan salad, no 
shredded carrots, soy dressing with 
no oil. Four ounces of sea bass, 
grilled, no oil. And have these 
idiots send up three cases of smart 
water.
INT. VILLA/ALEX’S BATHROOM - DAY
Alex scrutinizes with keen eye, checking every follicle as 
Mimi striates hair dye with precise brush strokes. 
ALEX
We have to achieve the perfect 
balance of dark with just the 
sexiest flecks of silver.
MIMI
I don’t understand why a writer 
needs sexy flecks.
ALEX
It’s very simple, Mimi, youth is heat. 
Heat is money.
MIMI
Oui, oui. Money is ‘eat.
ALEX
No. Money is cool. Heat is money. 
Youth is heat. You get it? Youth is 
heat. Heat is money. And money is very 
cool.
MIMI
You must get some of this very cool 
money and save the ‘ouse.
ALEX
That’s why I’m going to the festival, 
darling Mimi. To save the ‘ouse.
He points to his shaving kit.GRETCHEN (cont’d)6."
"7.MIMI
No, monsieur. Don’t shave your beard! 
It make you look so ‘andsome.
ALEX
Have to, Mimi. I’m unemployed.
(begins lathering up)
Do we have any fake tan?
Of course she knows exactly where to find it.
INT. ALEX’S BEDROOM - MORNING
Alex is clean shaven and bronzed, quite impressive looking. 
He and Mimi stand before a giant armoire, staring at the 
clothes hanging inside.
MIMI
Maybe we should buy you a new suit.
ALEX
Nonsense, Mimi. It’s old. But it’s 
classic. Everything in this closet 
is vintage cool, from the Cortébert 
watch to the McQueen chukka boots.
He begins pulling out outfits and holding them up for Mimi.
INT. PINK SUITE - DAY
LORI, a slim, sexy woman in her late twenties with actress 
good looks, wearing a Stella McCartney cocktail dress, sits a 
bit nervously across from GARY BERGEN, super attractive and 
fashion forward, from his Tom Ford glasses to his Balenciaga 
tennis shoes, beaming his casual confidence.
LORI
Thanks for seeing me.
GARY
No problem. Where are you staying, 
Lori?
LORI
Oh, in some little place outside of 
town. It’s impossible to get a room at 
the last minute.
GARY
Well, it’s nice of you to stop by. 
It’s unusual for a writer’s wife to 
make a pitch for her husband.7."
"8.LORI
I know, well, it's just that he's 
perfect for your project, but he heard 
that you were looking at more 
established writers.
Gary steals a look at her cleavage. Smallish... but tasty.
GARY
And why do you think he's so perfect 
for the job?
LORI
Because this is an amazingly cool 
project and it doesn’t need old 
establishment writers. It needs a 
writer who’s fresh and cool and 
brings the right energy. That’s my 
husband. He’s got amazing energy. 
And he’s somebody who knows what 
everybody wants a year before they 
know they want it. This is the kind 
of thing he's dreamed about doing 
his whole life. It's... I don't 
know how to put it in words...
(looks up at him; pointedly)
I'd do anything to help him get this 
job.
The game is on.
GARY
Anything?
She holds his eye contact.
LORI
Anything.
Gary smiles; thinks.
GARY
You'd show me the best time I ever had 
in my life? And I do mean the best.
Lori holds his eye contact; nods deliciously.
LORI
Better.
That’s what he wanted to hear.
GARY 
Stand up.8."
"9.She rises ever so seductively. He hungrily takes in her shape 
beneath the tight dress. She brushes a hand across her tanned 
décolletage. Gary's voice comes from deep down in his genitals.
GARY
Take off your panties.
She fishes her hand up her dress and tugs down the panties. He 
watches them slide down her long luscious thighs and fall to the 
floor. Gary's salivating. She is one sexy thing.
GARY
For the rest of our time together you 
abandon all inhibitions. You do not 
speak the word “no.” I am going to do 
things to you no one ever dreamed of. 
Do you like the sound of that?
LORI
Yes.
GARY
Drop your dress.
Gary watches hungrily as she slowly lowers her dress, revealing 
an achingly beautiful body. As the dress slides down:
MATCH CUT:
INT. ALEX’S BEDROOM - DAY - ALEX PULLS HIS PANTS UP
They’re a bit snug. Mimi waits. He tries to button his pants. No 
luck. Mimi shakes her head and clucks.
MIMI
Mon dieu, how you get so fat?
ALEX
You could let them out a little, 
couldn’t you?
MIMI
Give them to me.
He sheepishly steps out of his pants and hands them over. She 
looks at him standing there in his boxers, clucks some more.
MIMI
(admonishing)
I’m cooking no more for you.
ALEX
Then I’d have nothing to live for. 9."
"10.MIMI
You can live to ‘ave ‘ot... or ‘eat 
again! To be very ‘eated up.
She leaves with his trousers, clucking and fussing the whole way 
out. Alex looks round the room, thinks, then:
ALEX
(calling out)
Mimi, could you bring me a plate of 
croissants and some coffee?
No response. He pats his stomach, then sucks it in.
ALEX
She’s right. I gotta hit the gym.
(thinks, then he shouts)
And some of your apricot jam!
CUT TO:
INT. PURPLE SUITE - DAY
Gretchen is once again on the phone.
GRETCHEN
Do you have ellipticals in the 
gym?...
INTERCUT WITH:
THE CONCIERGE STATION
The CONCIERGE tries his best to be helpful.
CONCIERGE
I’m sorry, madam, alaypteepcals?
GRETCHEN
You know, like a stairstepper. What 
kind of stairsteppers do you have?... 
What part of the question don’t you 
understand?
(condescendingly)
Are they the big kind with lots of 
lights and buttons, or the little kind 
you people use to train your goats?
The Concierge starts to explain, then thinks better of it.
CUT TO:10."
"11.INT. PINK SUITE - DAY
The once neat room is now a wreck. Chairs are scattered, wine 
bottles lie on there side. Gary and Lori lie behind the couch in 
that tousled afterglow of sexual carnage. The PHONE RINGS.
GARY
Could you get that, honeyplum?
Lori scurries over to the phone.
LORI
Hello... Oh, hi, Antonio... Uh-huh... 
Yeah, hang on a second.
(to Gary)
Honeybunch, it's Antonio. He wants to 
know if you can meet him on the 
Croisette.
Gary emerges from behind the sofa, rubs his face, and responds 
sweetly.
GARY
Sure, pumpkin. Tell him I just got to 
shower and I'll be right down.
LORI
(into phone)
Antonio, give him twenty minutes and 
he’ll come down and meet you... Okay, 
bye.
She hangs up, goes over to Gary and plants a kiss on his mouth. 
Smiles.
LORI
Honey, you should become a sex 
therapist.
He grins, full of self-satisfaction.
GARY
The one thing I do better than 
writing, sugardumpling.
He kisses her and heads into the shower.
CUT TO:
EXT. VILLA - DAY
A gorgeous afternoon. Sun kisses full flowers. Bees buzz. Alex 
emerges from the house, looking like he just stepped out of 
Steve McQueen’s time machine. Dapper Bullit blazer, navy mock 
turtleneck, chukka boots. Very cool.11."
"12.He goes to the garage with Mimi right behind him, plucking stray 
hairs and lint from his jacket. He yanks up the deteriorating 
garage door to reveal a pristine green vintage Jaguar.
EXT. GREEN JAGUAR - DAY
Winds down the mountainous drive with Alex at the wheel. The 
radio plays 50s French jazz. He smoothly navigates the car 
around the dangerous ruts, nosing out over each steep precipice 
with practiced insouciance. At the bottom of the hill, he swings 
the car out on to the coastal road. Could a man be cooler?
EXT. CANNES - DAY
The film festival is in full swing. The city goes mad. People 
pack the streets. The beaches flow with topless women and 
oglers. Alex’s jaguar is stuck in bumper to bumper traffic.
INT. HOTEL BAR - A SERIES OF CUTS - THROUGHOUT THE DAY
Alex tries to mingle, working his way up and down the bar, 
eavesdropping, looking for an opening that never comes. 
Eventually, he sidles up to:
An older hipster listens to the pitch of the newest VISIONARY 
DIRECTOR.
VISIONARY DIRECTOR
And at the end of the show, the 
camera reverses and the entire 
global audience gets to see each 
other in real time, all in 
organized pods, and they can vote 
on who gets ritually executed.
Alex leans in and offers:
ALEX
When you say a pod, is that 
metaphorical?
The visionary directer shares an eye roll with the older 
hipster.
TIME CUT:
A FEMALE PRODUCER PITCHES TO
Alex. Amazingly he’s found somebody to talk to him.
FEMALE PRODUCER
It’s Romeo and Juliet but with no 
defined gender roles.12."
"13.ALEX
How do you mean? Isn’t Romeo and 
Juliet about a young boy and girl 
in love?
FEMALE PRODUCER 
Why do you have to label them? Do 
they really need those shackles?
Alex starts to explain, thinks better of it and eases away.
TIME CUT:
A NEW ERA YOUNG AGENT
Pitches to a painfully unfashionable older sales agent. 
YOUNG AGENT
We don’t call ourselves an agency, 
we’re more like a decentralized 
collective, completely vegan, non-
hierarchical, pronoun fluid...
Alex knows this is pointless; turns to find:
A GEN Z FEMALE JUNIOR EXEC 
She has four smartphones laid out on the bar before her and 
systematically goes from tiktok to instagram to twitter to 
facebook, posting and responding within mere seconds.
Alex realizes he is totally out of his element. He lifts a 
finger to the bartender.
ALEX
Could you bring me a bourbon? And a 
beer.
The bartender nods and sets ‘em up. Alex swills the beer, 
knocks back the bourbon and heads for the toilet. A hard day.
INT. BATHROOM - DUSK
Alex finishes peeing and zips up. GARY BERGEN enters; stops in 
his tracks when he spots Alex.
GARY
I don’t believe it! Elvis is alive, 
folks!
Alex is stunned to see him.
ALEX
Gary! Wow, man, this is incredible! 
It’s great to see you.13."
"14.He offers his hand. Gary doesn’t take it, gives a little smirk. 
Alex realizes he hasn’t washed it. They hug.
GARY
You too, dude. Wash your hands.
Alex washes. Gary checks his teeth in the mirror.
GARY
Man, what the hell are you doing here?
ALEX
Well, you know I just live in the 
hills, outside of town.
GARY
Yeah, I know that, dude. But, I never 
thought I’d see you at a film 
festival. You’ve always hated this 
bullshit.
ALEX
Hey, it’s been a while. And I thought 
I’d come in and get a little taste of 
glamour.
GARY
Come on, I got a surprise for you.
He leads Alex out of the bathroom.
INT. MAJESTIC HOTEL/LOUNGE - DUSK
Gary brings Alex to a table in the middle of the action.
GARY
Look who I found!
Antonio jumps to his feet.
ANTONIO
Alex!
ALEX
Antonio! Great to see you!
ANTONIO
It’s wonderful to see you, too, dear 
boy. How have you been?
ALEX
Life is good, Antonio. How are you?14."
"15.ANTONIO
Fabulous. Alex, I want you to meet 
Nita. She’s incredible. We’re making a 
film about her amazing life.
He indicates the 19-year-old stunner in the show-all dress and 
tiny pooch - NITA. Alex smiles and takes her hand.
ALEX
Enchante, Nita.
She gives him a cursory smile.
GARY
Alex, you remember my wife, Lori.
Lori, the All-American-Slut-Turned-Wife-Of-Successful-
Screenwriter. Alex knows well this type.
ALEX
Of course. Nice to see you again, 
Lori.
Air kisses.
Nita whispers to Antonio.
NITA
Does he have money?
ANTONIO
No, he’s a writer.
Alex’s attention is drawn to a silent presence at the far end of 
the table. He looks over --
And there she is, looking as surprised to see him as he is to 
see her -- GRETCHEN  
She wears a short, tight dress with no place to hide a weapon. 
She doesn’t need one. She’s deadly. The whole package. She 
forces a Hollywood smile. It’s obvious they have a history.
GRETCHEN
Hello, Alex.
ALEX
Gretchen, what a surprise. How have 
you been?
He leans over and shakes her hand.
GRETCHEN
Wonderful. How’s life in Goatland?
ALEX
Gamy. May I sit?15."
"16.He indicates the empty chair beside her. She nods, coolly. He 
sits. She sizes him up.
GRETCHEN
Is that the same jacket you wore when 
we dated?
ALEX
Probably.
Antonio waves for drinks.
LATER:
Antonio is off at other tables, glad handing and schmoozing. 
Gary and Lori yak with Nita.
Alex and Gretchen find themselves off to the side, thrown 
together. They both pour down drinks to loosen things up.
ALEX
So you ever see any of the old staff 
from Cruel City?
GRETCHEN
Some of them. The successful ones.
You remember Chris Kemfield?
ALEX
Yeah. Great guy. Good writer too.
GRETCHEN
I had to fire him last week.
ALEX
What happened?
GRETCHEN
We just weren’t on the same page.
Alex nods, doesn’t know quite how to respond, smiles dumbly.
GRETCHEN
I replaced him with a great new writer 
I found when I was lecturing at Yale. 
Fabulous, knows action like a Navy 
Seal, twenty-two year old African-
American LGBTQ+.
Alex doesn’t know what she’s talking about.
ALEX
Plus what?16."
"17.INT. NIGHT CLUB - LATER
Alex and Gretchen are on the dance floor. Antonio’s making deals 
at a table full of players. Nita dances with a tuxedoed rasta, 
her toy dog in one hand while she takes selfies with the other.
Lori and Gary sit off to the side watching Alex and Gretchen 
on the dance floor.
GARY
Come on, when you first met Alex, tell 
me you didn’t fantasize about him. 
Just a little?
LORI
Hey, he was your idol. By the time I 
met him, he was on the way down and 
you were shooting up.
GARY
Thank you, sugarplum, but come on, I’m 
not gonna be insulted. The guy’s 
always been like a total chick magnet.
LORI
It was before my time, sweetie. He’s 
just some paunchy old guy to me.
He grins and gives her a big smooch.
GARY
You’re the greatest. Let’s dance.
He drags her out on to the dance floor.
GRETCHEN AND ALEX - DANCING
He’s dripping sweat. A life of too much wine, red meat, and 
homemade jam taking its toll. On the other hand, Gretchen’s 
pumping like a piston. He raises a finger.
ALEX
(shouting above the noise)
I need a breather!
INT. NIGHT CLUB/MEN’S ROOM - EVENING
Alex staggers in, gulping for air. His clothes are dripping. He 
splashes water on his face. A super fit YOUNG GUY looks at him, 
concerned he’s about to have a heart attack.
YOUNG GUY
Ça va?17."
"18.ALEX
(in French)
Oui. Merci. These young women never 
stop. I don’t remember ever having to 
dance this much.
YOUNG GUY
Ç’est Vrai. It is a test. They want to 
see if you have enough stamina.
ALEX
Enough stamina for what? A triathlon?
The young guy smiles knowingly and bounces an eyebrow.
ALEX
You actually screw them after a night 
of this?
YOUNG GUY
No. We are usually too tired.
They share a shrug. Alex mops his face with a towel.
INT. NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT
Gretchen and Alex are huddled off to the side while Antonio, 
Lori and Gary sit with more dealmakers.
ALEX
So tell me about this new project you 
and Antonio have.
GRETCHEN
It’s amazing. Taken from the French 
headlines about six months ago. You 
met Nita, Antonio’s new girlfriend?
She indicates Nita and dog on dance floor.
GRETCHEN
Her story’s incredible! We bought it 
immediately. She was involved with an 
Algerian guy, he was her pimp 
actually, and the romance ended in a 
tragic shooting.
Alex lifts his brow, curiosity piqued.
ALEX
Really? Tell me more.
Lori’s radar perks up.
TIME CUT:18."
"19.AS THE PARTY CONTINUES:
Antonio talks deals while Gary dances with Nita and the 
pooch. Alex is huddled with Gretchen while Lori watches them.
GRETCHEN
So Nita’s poor mother catches her with 
this Algerian and tries to drag her 
out. But the Algerian is, you know, 
probably an arms smuggler as well as a 
pimp. So he takes out his gun and 
shoots Nita’s mother.
ALEX
Dead?
GRETCHEN
Very. Nita realizes that her mother 
was only trying to save her so she 
picks up the gun and shoots the 
Algerian.
ALEX
Dead?
GRETCHEN
With extreme prejudice.
Folds her arms and waits. Finished.
ALEX
Wow! That is heavy duty. You’ve got to 
be careful though, or it’ll turn into 
one of those melodramas they were 
doing in the late seventies.
GRETCHEN
I don’t remember that far back.
Alex nods, right.
ALEX
You know, it could be really 
interesting. And if you haven’t hired 
anyone yet, I’d love to talk about it.
GRETCHEN
(coyly)
Nothing’s in stone.
Lori overhears this, practically explodes.
ALEX
Great. Hey, would you like to come see 
my place tomorrow? We could have 
something to eat and talk up there. My 
housekeeper’s a great cook.19."
"20.GRETCHEN
Well, I’m not really interested in 
your housekeeper’s cooking, but I’m 
sure you’ll find other ways to 
entertain me. 
Alex smiles at her drunken innuendo. Lori seethes.
INT. MAJESTIC HOTEL/HALLWAY - NIGHT
Gretchen is tipsy. Alex sees her to her door. 
ALEX
Call me when you’re at the bottom 
of my hill and I’ll come down and 
get you. Do not attempt to drive up 
or you’ll go right over the cliff. 
It was great seeing you, again.
He leans in to give her an air kiss. She turns and catches him 
full on the mouth and practically chokes him. He pulls away, 
quickly composes himself.
GRETCHEN
Why don’t you come in for a nightcap?
ALEX
It wouldn’t be right to take advantage 
of you in this state.
GRETCHEN
Like that’s ever stopped you?
He waves an admonishing finger at her; smiles indulgently.
ALEX
I’ll see you tomorrow night.
GRETCHEN  
Shuts the door behind her.
GRETCHEN
Prick.
ALEX  
Heads for the elevator.
ALEX
Bitch.
EXT. CANNES - DAY
Cannes buzzes in full festival bloom.20."
"21.EXT. MARKET - DAY
Mimi fills her basket with produce. GEORGE, the grocer adds it 
up.
GEORGE
Thirty-two euro.
MIMI
Put it on the account, George.
He’s not pleased.
GEORGE
If this American can’t pay, he 
should come to me instead of 
sending you to do his dirty work.
MIMI
He sent me for the vegetables, 
George. 
GEORGE
You should marry me.
MIMI
So I could do your dirty work?
She shoves one last eggplant into her bag and turns on her 
heels. George watches her go, chewing his lip, dreaming. 
Then, he tallies the bill in his ledger.
INT. VILLA/STUDY - MORNING
Alex leans over his desk, staring at a blank notepad. He thinks. 
Nothing. He writes: “Pimp.” “Hooker.” “Mother.” He paces. More 
nothing.
ALEX
Why doesn’t this get any easier?
He catches sight of himself in the mirror, pulls at the extra 
skin on his neck; turns to attain a more flattering angle.
EXT. SWIMMING POOL - DAY
A WOMAN IN SWIMMER’S CAP AND GOGGLES - ECU
Emerges from the water, her mouth twisted angrily.
WOMAN
You’re shitting in my temple.
She raises her goggles. It’s Gretchen.21."
"22.GRETCHEN
My workouts are sacred to me.
Antonio’s face leans in to her.
ANTONIO
I’m sorry, darling, but we have to 
talk about this.
GRETCHEN
There’s nothing to talk about. I said 
not one penny  more and I meant, “not 
one penny more.”
ANTONIO
It’ll come out of the budget...
GRETCHEN
As what, extortion?
ANTONIO
(offers)
Rights?
GRETCHEN
Wrong. You pay for your upgrades. 
Reset my timer.
She points to the timer on her poolside phone, lowers her 
goggles and pushes off. Antonio frustratedly resets her phone 
and walks off. Gretchen returns to the side of the pool, 
picks up her cellphone and calls her assistant.
GRETCHEN
Cancel Antonio’s company card.
She hangs up and goes back to her laps.
INT. VILLA/KITCHEN - AFTERNOON
Alex and Mimi prepare dinner, side by side. He washes lettuce 
leaves. She pares the haricot verts. A sweet domestic moment.
ALEX
It’s a stupid job, but it should pay 
enough to get us out of this hole.
MIMI
What is it about?
ALEX
Some ridiculous story about a young 
girl in love with a pimp. He shoots 
her mother and she kills him.22."
"23.MIMI
That’s horrible.
ALEX
And supposedly true.
MIMI
No!
He smiles; enjoying titillating her. She elbows him.
ALEX
Ç’est Vrai.
She shakes her head, savoring the closeness as they continue 
working.  After a moment:
MIMI
You are going to ‘ave sex with this 
woman?
He turns, inches from her face.
ALEX
(awkward)
No!...Umm... I don’t know... 
He tries to read her, but she’s cool.
ALEX
I guess if that’s what it takes to get 
the job. Do you think I should?
She shrugs indifferently.
MIMI
If you can save the ‘ouse, than you 
should screw her.
ALEX
(a bit taken aback)
That doesn’t bother you?
MIMI
Why should it bother me? You Americans 
make too much importance on sex.
He’s surprised by her casualness; doesn’t see it’s a show.
EXT/INT. THE COAST/CAR - DUSK
GRETCHEN drives along the coastal road in her rented 
Mercedes. Traffic is intermittent as she gets further from 
Cannes.23."
"24.She spots the landmark. Stops the car and dials her i-phone. No 
signal. Tries texting. Nothing. She grabs her Chanel bag, gets 
out and tries again. Still no signal. She looks up the hill at 
Alex’s villa on top.
Begins walking up the steep drive. It proves much more difficult 
than she thought. She catches her heel in a rut and almost trips 
over.
GRETCHEN
Shit!
She rubs her ankle. Looks at the washed out drive above.
GRETCHEN
You ever hear of tarmac!
She continues her climb.
MOMENTS LATER
Gretchen doesn’t like what the drive is doing to her shoes. She 
stops and takes them off. Tries texting again. The phone slips 
out of her hand and cracks on a rock.
GRETCHEN
Oh, great.
She picks it up and tries dialing. Nothing.
GRETCHEN
Shit!!!
She furiously throws the phone down. It shatters. She leaves the 
ruined i-phone and fishes a second phone from her bag. She tries 
again. No signals. She continues hiking up the hill.
EXT. VILLA - DUSK
GRETCHEN finally arrives at the house. She stops to take it 
all in. Not bad. She composes herself and knocks on the front 
door.
INT. VILLA - DUSK
Mimi answers the door. Mimi sizes up the perfectly put together 
women who barely throws her a look. 
GRETCHEN
Is this Alex Lombard’s house?
MIMI
Oui.24."
"25.Gretchen steps in, shoves her Chanel bag in Mimi’s hand. 
Gretchen takes in the large foyer, notices the discoloration 
left by the missing painting. Alex bounds down the stairs.
ALEX
Hello. Why didn’t you call?
GRETCHEN
Couldn’t get a signal. And the walk 
was lovely.
He notices Mimi watching from the side, a third wheel; picks up 
on the tension. Takes Gretchen’s elbow and leads her into the 
main salon.
ALEX
A little champagne?
GRETCHEN
Love it.
He shuts the doors behind them. Mimi watches, face burning. 
SHE FURIOUSLY FLINGS GRETCHEN’S CHANEL BAG ACROSS THE ROOM.
INT. VILLA - EVENING
Alex and Gretchen sit facing each other on the sofas in front of 
the french doors.
ALEX
The main foundation was built in the 
Eleventh Century. Around the time of 
the First Crusade. This part of the 
villa was originally a chapel.
GRETCHEN
That’s amazing. How far is the 
airport?
ALEX
Twenty minutes.
GRETCHEN
Great.
Alex runs his finger along the cushion as they speak, feels 
something under the pillow and fishes out a condom. He jumps to 
his feet, hiding the condom back under the pillow.
ALEX
Come on, let me show you the view.
He leads her out on to the terrace.25."
"26.GRETCHEN
It’s fantastic, Alex. Like “To Catch A 
Thief.”
ALEX
Do I remind you of Cary Grant?
GRETCHEN
(with a hint of innuendo)
You always have.
She points to a room below under construction.
GRETCHEN
What’s this?
ALEX
Oh, that’s a guest room I’m fixing up.
GRETCHEN
(pointedly)
Really? You gonna rent it out to 
college girls?
Alex narrows his eyes at her.
ALEX
What’s that supposed to mean?
She smiles. There’s a game afoot and Alex is a step behind.
LATER - BACK IN THE LIVING ROOM
A second bottle of champagne is killed.
GRETCHEN
You really were something. You 
inspired all of us to reach for the 
stars.
ALEX
A line I stole from Tennessee 
Williams.
GRETCHEN
You always said, “Talent borrows. 
Genius steals.”
ALEX
On that note, I’ve stolen some genius 
ideas for your hooker-kills-pimp-who-
killed-mommy story. You want to hear 
them?26."
"27.GRETCHEN
No. I want to drink some more 
champagne and hump.
Alex is taken aback.
ALEX
Umm, okay, let me get another bottle.
He hops out.
INT. FOYER - CONTINUOUS
Alex finds Mimi just outside the door. He shuts it behind him 
and whispers.
ALEX
Mimi, you can’t hover around us. 
It’s making me nervous and I’m 
trying to get a job.
MIMI
I was not ‘overing. I was putting 
out the cassoulet.
ALEX
Thank you, Mimi. Now please go to 
bed.
She huffs off.
EXT. VILLA/TERRACE - EVENING
Alex and Gretchen take their glasses out to the terrace where a 
steaming stew pot awaits them on a wrought iron table. Alex 
lifts the lid and lovingly stirs with a ladle. He inhales the 
intoxicating aroma; smiles.
GRETCHEN
Smells delicious. What is it?
ALEX
Cassoulet. Mimi makes the greatest 
cassoulet in the world. Carcasonne 
style. Definitely not nouvelle.
GRETCHEN
Cassoulet? That’s beans.
Alex breathes in the heady vapors.
ALEX
An amazing amalgam of beans, sausage, 
and duck fat.27."
"28.GRETCHEN
(under her breath)
Great. What doesn’t go on my thighs 
will blow out my ass.
ALEX
What?
GRETCHEN
Oh, nothing.
She comes over, takes the ladle out of his hands and drops it 
back in the pot. Alex sadly watches his cassoulet escape. She 
turns him to face her.
GRETCHEN
You know what? I haven’t seen you in a 
very long time. I kind of had 
something other than eating beans in 
mind.
She puts her arms round his neck. Stares into his eyes.
GRETCHEN
You ever think of the nights we 
stayed up doing “script revisions?”
ALEX
Some of my sexiest memories.
GRETCHEN
Mine too.
He sneaks a hungry look at the stew pot.
GRETCHEN
Could you take your eyes off the beans 
for a minute and put them on my  
cleavage.
He dutifully snaps his head back. Takes her in. She looks great. 
Golden salon tan. Gym perfect physique. Excellent boob job. She 
looks almost as delicious as the cassoulet. She brings her face 
right up to his.
GRETCHEN
That’s right. Now put your hands on my 
ass.
His hands slide down to her buttocks. 
GRETCHEN
That is the tautest ass you will 
ever feel. No beans and duckfat go 
near those glutes.28."
"29.ALEX
They’re incredibly hard.
GRETCHEN
Yes, they are. Now you show me 
something hard.
She presses her mouth to his. Alex is swallowed whole.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. VILLA/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Alex is drenched in the afterglow, his face still a bit red, 
smiling in that self-satisfied way only men can. He buttons 
his shirt as she slips on her dress.
ALEX
Wow, that certainly works up a good 
appetite. That was amazing!
He looks to her for approval. Waits. She zips up the side of 
her dress. Finally:
GRETCHEN
Wasn’t as good as I remembered it.
Alex is deflated, but tries to be chivalrous. 
ALEX
I’m sorry. But the years have only 
made you more incredible.
She takes him in with sneering contempt.
GRETCHEN
I was so in love with you. Everybody 
thought you were going to be the man 
who’d change the world.
He vulnerably stares at her.
ALEX
I’m sorry I let you down.
GRETCHEN
Hey, my life is great. You just let 
yourself down. Look at you. An aging 
has-been, desperate for work, who 
doesn’t realize it’s all passed him 
by.
Alex is completely bewildered. 
ALEX
Why are you saying all this, Gretchen?29."
"30.She smiles cruelly.
GRETCHEN
I’m trying to get as much pleasure as 
I possibly can out of telling you that 
Gary’s getting the job.
An uppercut.
ALEX
Gretchen, listen. Let me take a shot 
at a draft. If you don’t love it, 
bring in Gary. I really need the work.
GRETCHEN
Alex, don’t beg. There is no way in 
the universe you’re gonna get this 
job. You can have the Godfather put a 
dead horse in my bed and it wouldn’t 
change a thing. I’ve waited ten years 
to get you and nothing’s gonna stop 
me.
Her venom flows like lava.
ALEX
Gretchen, I’m truly sorry for what 
happened. I didn’t realize how much I 
hurt you. But please, don’t do this. I 
need the job. Yes, I’m begging. I’m 
going to lose my home.
GRETCHEN
And I’ll await your foreclosure with 
eager anticipation. In fact, I think 
I’ll bid on this cute little hacienda 
when they repossess it.
ALEX
It’s not a hacienda. It’s a villa. 
This is France, not Mexico.
GRETCHEN
It’s any fucking thing I want to call 
it, once it’s mine. C’est la vie, 
loser.
He’s shaken, but meets her vicious eyes; stares for a long 
moment, then:
ALEX
You know, even in the bloom of your 
youth, it was obvious you’d turn out 
this way.
GRETCHEN
Fuck you.30."
"31.ALEX
Is that your comeback for 
everything? Fuck you? No wonder 
movies are so terrible. Witless 
poseurs like you in charge of 
everything.
GRETCHEN
Double fuck you, loser.
She punches him in the face. He stares at her, dazed.
GRETCHEN
Flabby, middle-aged, has-been!
She punches him again! Blood trickles from his nose. He brings 
his stunned fingers to his face and feels the blood. But she’s 
not done.
GRETCHEN
That’s right bitch! When you’re 
slapped you’ll take it!
She bitch slaps him, again and again. He snaps and FIRES A LONE 
PUNCH BACK WHICH CATCHES HER FLUSH ON THE CHIN. She flies over 
an antique ottoman. He realizes he’s just punched a woman.
ALEX
Oh, God, Gretchen, are you okay?
He tries to help her up. She kicks his legs out from under him!
IT’S ON! She starts whirling furious fists at him. Catches one 
in his crotch. He manages to wrestle her into a headlock.
GRETCHEN
Motherfucking idealist cocksucker!
She’s enraged, a fully ferocious fem dervish. She punches his 
crotch again and again. SHE MANAGES TO GRAB HIS BALLS, TWISTS 
AND SQUEEZES. He groans. She doesn’t let up. The tide is turning 
against Alex. She’s wriggling out of his grasp!
ALEX
Ball-busting, All-American twat!
She slips out of the headlock! Kicks him in the stomach. He 
doubles over. She drops him with an elbow smash. He lands face 
first. She gets behind him and locks a forearm around his 
throat.
GRETCHEN
Gracie chokehold, Francophile faggot!
She squeezes. His eyes bulge. He can’t breathe! He begins 
gasping! His hand gropes desperately for a lifeline - something - 
anything! Then --31."
"32.His fingers find his precious WRITER’S GUILD AWARD. He swings 
the thing into her temple!
SHE CRUMBLES!
Alex stares in horror at the limp woman. A thin line of blood 
trails from her nostril. He knows.
ALEX
Oh, Jesus.
He kneels over her; searches for signs of life. She doesn’t 
move.
ALEX
Oh, Jesus!
He turns down the lights. Runs over to the window and peers 
outside. All is quiet. He stares down at Mimi’s window. It’s 
dark.
ALEX
Oh God oh shit oh Christ what have I 
done?
He tries again to feel for her pulse. Nothing.
ALEX
Oh Jesus.
CUT TO:
EXT. VILLA - NIGHT
Alex fireman carries Gretchen down the drive, glancing round in 
terror as he goes. Making sure no one can see him.
When he comes almost to the bottom of the drive, he leaves her 
body on the ground, scurries down the rest of the way and peers 
out along the road.
It’s empty. Gretchen’s Mercedes is parked ten meters away.
Alex goes back and re-hoists Gretchen; bounces over to the car 
with her. He props her along the side of the car; realizes.
ALEX
Her keys?
He searches her dress, but there are no pockets anywhere.
ALEX
Where are your keys?32."
"33.A headlight suddenly appears out of nowhere. A frozen moment 
of terror and then Alex grabs the woman’s face and plants a 
kiss on her dead lips, pretending to be making out as the car 
shoots by.
When the car disappears, Alex looks under the car seat, the 
floor mat. He checks the glove compartment, panic steadily 
rising.
ALEX
Where are your fucking keys!
He checks on top of each wheel and finally his head sinks 
against the fender. He clenches his fist and pounds his head.
ALEX
Think, you idiot!
As another set of headlights appears, Gretchen’s body slumps 
down her face buries in his crotch as the car shoots past. 
Alex waits, frozen, until the car disappears.
Then he drags Gretchen’s body into a drainage ditch.
ALEX
Okay, she said she had to meet some 
friends in town and said goodbye at 
around...
(checks his watch)
Eleven.
He stealthily trots back up his drive, leaving Gretchen’s body 
in the ditch.
ALEX
A carload of thugs must have been 
waiting by her car...
He scurries up the hill, going over his story for the police, 
never noticing as HE STEPS OVER THE DISCARDED I-PHONE.
INT. DRAINAGE DITCH - NIGHT
GRETCHEN’s body lies in the DITCH. Limp arm extended out in 
front of her.
INT. VILLA - NIGHT
Alex goes back into the living room. He’s a wreck.
ALEX
Did she have a bag when she came in 
here?33."
"34.He searches everywhere. Nothing. He spots traces of dark liquid 
on the rug and hardwood floor.
ALEX
Is that wine or blood?
He gets a wash bucket and begins scrubbing the floor, reaching 
for alibis as he dabs at the blood stain.
ALEX
She had a bit too much to drink. I 
should have driven her home myself. 
This is my fault!
(winces)
Too self-incriminating. 
He keeps scrubbing at the stain.
EXT. DRAINAGE DITCH - NIGHT
A car motors past the Mercedes sitting at the side of the 
road, never noticing the body lying in the ditch. Then, 
GRETCHEN’S FINGER GIVES A TWITCH!
After a moment, a second twitch. Gretchen’s fingers come back to 
life then grab a fistful of grass. She drags herself up and 
looks around.
She sits with her back against the car. Rubs some sense into her 
aching head. Slowly, she remembers what happened and realizes 
where she is.
GRETCHEN
You dump me in a ditch in front of 
your house? That’s the way you get 
rid of a corpse? Haven’t you 
written enough procedurals, you 
moron?
She gets to her feet and stares up the hill at the light in 
Alex’s house. Her face darkens venomously.
GRETCHEN
Oh, it is on, Alex.

EXT. HILLS ABOVE NICE - MORNING
Sun warms the hills above Nice. A breathtaking morning.34."
"35.INT. VILLA/ALEX’S BEDROOM - MORNING
Alex hasn’t slept. He’s a complete wreck, replaying different 
alibis.
ALEX
We had a great meeting and she told 
me to show up for work at 11 this 
morning.
 Examines his eye bags in the mirror. What to do?
ALEX
Mimi!!!
Mimi rushes in.
MIMI
What’s wrong, Alex?
ALEX
Look at me! I have a meeting in one 
hour!
MIMI
(shaking her head)
Stop panicking. I will fix it.
Mimi begins hastily gathering his beauty products. She yanks 
open a cupboard and accidentally whacks it into her forehead. 
ALEX
Are you okay?
She quickly dabs a small cut at her hairline and goes to 
work.
MIMI
I am fine. Sit down and let’s get 
you pulled together.
She goes to work.
MOMENTS LATER
Alex sits like a frumpy matron while Mimi removes tea bags from 
his eyes. She begins applying eye gel.
ALEX
It’s very important that I look fresh 
for this meeting, Mimi.
MIMI
Oui, I know, Mr. ‘ot and cold.35."
"36.She carefully touches up his sagging eyes. Then something 
catches her eye. Alex notices her staring at his neck.
He looks in the mirror; sees an ugly gash where his windpipe 
almost popped. He self-consciously closes his shirt.
INT. VILLA - DAY
Alex tries to organize himself to leave, but he is frazzled. 
Mimi hands him his keys and notebook. He’s preoccupied.
ALEX
Mimi, could you have the rug cleaned? 
I spilled some wine on it last night.
MIMI
I’ll call Vaillard to pick it up 
today. Now stop worrying and go get 
the job.
He nods okay, heads out, disoriented.
EXT. VILLA/DRIVE - DAY
Alex maneuvers his convertible down the drive. He replays 
scenarios in his head.
ALEX
I came around the corner and I was 
surprised to find her car still 
parked there.
(slaps his forehead)
No! How the hell did you know it 
was her car!
As he drives, he tries to form a better story. The car rolls 
right over -- GRETCHEN’S CRACKED i-phone!
ALEX
At first I didn’t realize it was 
her car and then I spotted her body 
a few feet away...I can’t 
believe...
As Alex rounds the final bend he cranes his neck to see -- 
NOTHING!
Gretchen’s car is gone. The road is empty. Alex stops, looks up 
and down the road, but there is no sign of anything. As bad as 
it was going to be to call the police, this is worse.
He finds some Valium in the glove box, pops one, and pulls on to 
the main road.36."
"37.EXT. ROAD TO CANNES - DAY
Alex drives into Cannes, rehearsing his alibi, non-stop 
chattering in his head.

Good morning, Antonio! I’m here for 
the story meeting...
A CAR HORN, jerks him back into his own lane.
INT. ANTONIO’S SUITE - DAY
Nita answers the door, wearing only a thong. It’s Alex.
ALEX
Good morning.
Suddenly Nita’s lapdog comes out yapping and snapping at 
Alex’s ankles. He forces an indulgent smile. Nita scoops up 
the vicious little dog and gestures for Alex to follow her.
NITA
Antonio!
She leads him onto the balcony where Antonio’s having breakfast. 
Nita returns to her sunbathing and earbuds.
ANTONIO
Alex, what are you doing here?
ALEX
(casually)
I’m here for the story meeting.
Alex helps himself to a bite of croissant.
ANTONIO
(confused)
Story meeting? What story meeting?
ALEX
Gretchen said breakfast meeting in 
your room at eleven. Here I am.
ANTONIO
She didn’t... I had a very late night.
(calls out)
Darling, did Gretchen leave any 
messages?
(no response)
Pass me the phone.
Alex passes the phone over. Antonio dials. As he waits Alex 
neurotically gnaws his croissant. Antonio notices.37."
"38.ANTONIO
Wow, Alex, nobody feeds you?
Before Alex can respond Gretchen’s voicemail beeps on:
ANTONIO
Gretchen, Alex is here to start work. 
Call me when you wake up. Ciao.
Antonio regards Alex, bemused.
ANTONIO
So she hired you to write the script?
ALEX
(munching)
Mmm-hmmm.
Antonio digests this new scenario.
ANTONIO
You must have had a killer meeting.
ALEX
We bounced a few things around. And, 
you know, once we started spitballing.
ANTONIO
Come on, Alex. How did you get her to 
hire you? She promised the job to 
Gary.
ALEX
It was very simple, Antonio. I pointed 
out that I was twice the writer at 
half the price. You do the math.
ANTONIO
You negotiated a deal with her?
ALEX
Seventy-five against two-fifty. 
ANTONIO
That’s a quarter of Gary’s price.
ALEX
And half my old price. Hell of a deal. 
But we can renegotiate if you like.
ANTONIO
No, no. I’m happy. Let’s go to work. 
Let me just make a quick call. Have 
some coffee.38."

She collapses in a heap. The phone rings. The man’s hand reaches 
for it. It’s Gary, wearing GORILLA LIKE PROSTHETIC FOREARMS AND 
HANDS. Lori playfully pulls off the hands while Gary speaks.
GARY
Hello?... Yeah, hi Antonio... No, I 
haven’t forgotten. You can’t?...

Okay, no problem. I’ll see you in the

Alex and Antonio in the classic Hollywood story meeting.
ALEX
As is, the story is problematic. If we 
stay too faithful to the mother-saving-
her-daughter angle, we’ll wind up with 
the kind of jokey MOW they were doing 
twenty-five years ago.
ANTONIO
You know how I feel about being 
faithful to anything. Don’t worry 
about it. You’re the best. I know 
you’ll make it work.
ALEX
I’ve been doing a little research and 
there’s some really interesting night 
life in Marseilles that would give the 
plot a lot of romantic color.
ANTONIO
No. Don’t set it in France. Americans 
hate the French. You’ll kill my 
domestic sale.
ALEX
Antonio, you’re half French.
ANTONIO
Leave it out. I’m from Stepney. I’m 
only French when I come to Cannes.
ALEX
Okay, but, you know, the young 
Algerian could give this story a nice 
political tension.
ANTONIO
No. Forget all that political 
bullshit. Set it in New Orleans, okay? 
That will give it some real bayou 
mystery and sexiness. Make the 
Algerian kid a Cajun pimp. How’s that 
sound?
Alex is taken aback, but acquiesces.
ALEX
Uh... New Orleans is great. I love New 
Orleans... But...
ANTONIO
Good, because I need the Louisiana 
rebate. 
(MORE)40."
"ANTONIO (cont’d)41.Now you’re right about the mother 
angle, too movie of the week. Make the 
Cajun pimp and the young girl lovers 
caught between the demands of their 
overbearing - I don’t know - You 
figure out some kind of adult 
authority figure who’s preventing 
these two kids from being together.
ALEX
So, the guy that Nita killed isn’t a 
bad guy. He’s the misunderstood lover?
ANTONIO
Exactly, it’s total Romeo and Juliet. 
He’s a pimp. She’s a young prostitute. 
But he doesn’t want to pimp her 
because they’re in love. But his 
family demands that he sell her to, 
you know, some fat, sleazy old rich 
bastard. They’re forced to kill each 
other because...
Antonio waves a hand searching for the words.
ALEX
(finishing the sentence)
Society doesn’t understand them?
ANTONIO
Exactly! It’s a very romantic tragedy 
and those are the biggest sellers with 
kids. Silly plots we’ve seen a million 
times before, but the kids haven’t. 
Movies aren’t for adults, Alex, 
they’re for children. Try to remember 
that. Okay?
(pats Alex on back and walks 
him to door)
This has been really productive, Alex. 
You’re doing a great job.
Alex finds himself standing in the corridor on the other side of 
Antonio’s door. He heads for the elevator, and the inner chatter 
begins.
ALEX
(V.O.)
Okay, that went well. You’ve got the 
job. What’s the next Hollywood move? 
Everything is normal. What’s the 
natural...

He’s a pimp. She’s a new, young 
prostitute. But he doesn’t want to 
pimp her because they’re in love. But 
his family demands that he sell her to 
a fat sleazy old man, stop me if 
you’ve heard this before...
GARY
(preoccupied)
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
ALEX
So they kill themselves because 
society doesn’t understand their love.
He smirks and waits for a reaction. Gary takes it all in, slowly 
nodding his head, then:
GARY
Gretchen bought this take?
ALEX
(defensively)
Well, half Gretchen, half Antonio.
GARY
(wheels churning)
Huh.
Alex grows uneasy, waiting for his former friend to engage.
GARY
This seems a lot more Antonio than 
Gretchen. Where is she? I’ve been 
trying to call her.
ALEX
Uh, I don’t know. She set the story 
meeting and didn’t show up.
GARY
Gretchen didn’t show up? She didn’t 
miss a meeting when her mother was 
dying in the hospital.
Alex is sinking; tries to brass it out.
ALEX
Yeah, I know. She must have really 
tied one on last night. I don’t 
know. I was in bed.42."
"43.GARY
(to himself)
Huh.
ALEX
Let’s have one for the road.
Alex waves to the waiter.
INT. PINK SUITE - AFTERNOON
Lori has lovingly laid out all her new purchases. Shopping bags 
are everywhere. She’s admiring it all when Gary storms in.
GARY
You’re not gonna fucking believe this!
LORI
What is it, honey?
GARY
That two-faced bitch hired Alex!
LORI
What? What are you talking about?
GARY
Fucking Gretchen hired Alex to do my 
story!!!
LORI
What?!? She hired that has-been 
loser?!
GARY
Alex just told me! Bitch didn’t have 
the balls to tell me herself!
LORI
She begged you to take that job!
Gary paces and rails at the gods.
GARY
She’s always had a thing for Alex! 
Ever since she was an assistant on 
Cruel City, she’s been totally gone on 
him!
LORI
But she hates him now. And you’re the 
one who stayed friends with her! She 
promised you this project! She begged 
you to do it!43."
"44.GARY
Fuck her! And fuck Antonio! If they 
think that old hack is gonna get them 
a green light they’re on serious 
chemicals!
LORI
Did those idiots read his last 
script!? I mean, give me a fucking 
break - a city of ghost children?! 
GARY
It was an allegory about war.
LORI
Whatever.
Gary shakes his head and goes for the door.
GARY
I gotta find Gretchen.
EXT. ANTONIO’S BALCONY - AFTERNOON
Antonio is on the phone when Nita storms in. She throws 
herself on the couch to pout. Antonio sees something is 
wrong.
ANTONIO
(into phone)
Let me call you back, Cybile.
(to Nita)
What’s wrong, darling?
NITA
I was shopping and your company 
card was canceled. I was so 
embarrassed!
ANTONIO
What! She canceled my card? This is 
too much!
He gets out his phone and angrily punches in her number.
NITA
I could kill that bitch!
Antonio holds up a just-a-second finger.
ANTONIO
Gretchen, where the fuck are you? 
You missed two meetings today and 
now you’ve canceled my card without 
telling me! I’m a partner in this 
company! What The Actual Fuck!44."
"45.He hangs up. Nita fires a shot.
NITA
I sold my story to you. I thought 
you were the boss.
ANTONIO
I am the boss. Something fishy is 
going on.
Antonio paces, thinks, shaking his head.
ANTONIO
Something happened to her. I’m 
calling the police.
NITA
No. I hate the police. They always try 
to screw for free.
ANTONIO
Well stay in your room and you won’t 
have to screw any of them.
He calls.
INT. VILLA - AFTERNOON
Alex comes home and looks around for Mimi.
ALEX
Mimi! Mimi!
She comes running out of the kitchen.
MIMI
Alex, what’s wrong?
ALEX
I got the job!
Mimi gives a little shriek of delight and jumps into his arms. 
He swings her around. Victory!
ALEX
Where’s the champagne?
She hurries to the kitchen for a bottle and two glasses. Alex 
runs into the study.45."
"46.INT. VILLA/STUDY - MOMENTS LATER
Alex clears all the crap off his desk. Mimi enters with the 
champagne. Alex pops the bottle. He fills the glasses and offers 
a toast.
ALEX
To...
(can’t think of a toast)
The mortgage.
They clink and drink.
ALEX
Let’s go to work, gorgeous.
She opens the giant armoire to collect his supplies. He begins 
organizing the desk.
MIMI
It’s very nice to see you like this, 
Alex.
She flutters about, gathering legal pads and pencils. 
ALEX
It’s very nice to be like this, Mimi.
(turning on his computer)
Too bad we didn’t pay the internet 
bill.
MIMI
We will, very soon.
She lays his supplies on the desk.
ALEX
You know, something strange happened 
in Cannes, today.
MIMI
Strange? ‘ow?
ALEX
Gretchen never showed up for the 
meeting.
Mimi cocks an eyebrow.
MIMI
Why not?
ALEX
Don’t know. Nobody could find her. 
Very strange.46."
"47.MIMI
Maybe you screw ‘er so ‘ard, she 
couldn’t walk.
ALEX
That’s not funny, Mimi. Were you 
spying on us?
MIMI
Moi? What for?
ALEX
She left here at eleven o’ clock. 
Hardly enough time for any major 
screwing.
Mimi smiles, dubiously.
ALEX
What?
MIMI
Okay, so you give ‘er a quick one. 
That’s what American girls like.
ALEX
Could we please change the subject?
Mimi shrugs, whatever; heads for the door.
ALEX
Is there any leftover cassoulet?
She smiles and goes to fetch him a plate.
INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE - AFTERNOON
HENRI, the hotel manager, arrives with DETECTIVE LEON RUCHOTTE 
at Antonio’s suite.
HENRI
Monsieur, this is my good friend, 
Detective Leon Ruchotte.
Antonio lays on his continental charm.
ANTONIO
Ah, Detective, thank you for coming. 
Entre, s'il vous plait.
(to manager)
Merci, Henri.
The manager nods and disappears. Antonio leads Ruchotte into the 
living room. Nita passes in one of her skimpy outfits. Ruchotte 
discreetly turns away.47."
"48.ANTONIO
May I get you anything, Detective?
RUCHOTTE
No, no, please, tell me what happened.
ANTONIO
Probably nothing. A young, overworked 
woman in France with an expense 
account. Hopefully, she is having a 
nice fling and she will show up 
tomorrow with rosy cheeks.
Ruchotte waits.
RUCHOTTE
How long has she been missing, 
monsieur?
ANTONIO
As far as I can tell, since this 
morning.
(off his reaction)
But we’re here on business and it’s 
not like her to miss two meetings. 
She’s American.
Ruchotte takes it in, nods.
RUCHOTTE
I see.
ANTONIO
I’m sure I’m just being an hysterical 
old woman, but if you could make some 
very discreet inquiries. I don’t want 
to cause a disturbance.
RUCHOTTE
Monsieur, it is normal to wait 24 
hours. But I will see what I can do.
ANTONIO
Merci, Detective.
INT. VILLA/STUDY - AFTERNOON
Alex sits alone, twitchy as hell. His yellow pad is blank, 
except for Alex’s doodle of a car at the side of the road. Mimi 
softly enters. He quickly crumbles the drawing.
MIMI
Alex, what’s wrong?
He tries to cover.48."
"49.ALEX
Oh, nothing, Mimi. I’m just a little 
nervous. I haven’t done an assignment 
for a while.
She fixes him a brandy. Sees his blank pad.
MIMI
I am sorry I make you feel bad before.
ALEX
Don’t worry about it.
MIMI
Did you ‘ear what ‘appen to ‘er?
ALEX
(misinterprets; jumps)
No! Have you heard something?
MIMI
No. I thought maybe she call you.
Alex realizes he way overreacted; tries to downplay it.
ALEX
Oh. No, she hasn’t.
Mimi nods her head, thoughtfully. She can see he’s rattled.
INT. MAJESTIC HOTEL - AFTERNOON
Ruchotte speaks with the HEAD WAITER who is scrolling through 
the receipts. He stops.
HEAD WAITER
We delivered her breakfast at 8:45 
this morning.
RUCHOTTE
Do you know who brought it up?
Head Waiter reads.
HEAD WAITER
Lisette. She’s doing a double shift 
today.
(calls)
Lisette, come here.
LISETTE, a pretty, young woman comes over.
RUCHOTTE
You brought breakfast to the 
American woman in 1501 this 
morning?49."
"50.LISETTE
Oui, Monsieur.
RUCHOTTE
Did you actually see her there?
MAID
Very quickly. She was in the 
shower. She opened the door and 
thanked me with her horrible 
American accent.
Ruchotte nods.
INT. VILLA/STUDY - EVENING
Alex stares out the window at the lights along the dark bay. 
Half of the brandy in the decanter is gone.
ALEX
Come on. You know nothing gets the 
juices flowing like a little pressure.
(thinks)
Okay, murder is a lot of pressure.
He takes another shot of brandy.
ALEX
The good news is, it’s not a romantic 
comedy. So you don’t have to be light 
hearted.
(begins pacing)
Use this feeling, man. Come on, the 
nerves are raw. Let the emotions pour 
out. Two kids... Two kids in love... 
All alone. Nowhere to turn... Floating 
through life... Alone in... a boat - a 
raft... on the swamp... The moon casts 
its glow on their young faces... Okay, 
you can work with that...
He leans over his desk, makes a few notes. And the juices slowly 
start flowing.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - MORNING
Detective Ruchotte speaks with a CHAMBERMAID just outside 
Gretchen’s suite.
RUCHOTTE
The American woman who stays in this 
room. Can you tell me when you last 
saw her?50."
"51.CHAMBERMAID
Yesterday morning.
RUCHOTTE
In the morning? Are you sure?
CHAMBERMAID
She was leaving with a weekend bag.
Ruchotte makes a note in his little pad.
RUCHOTTE
Could you open her room, please.
She nods obediently and lets him in.
INT. PURPLE SUITE - CONTINUOUS
The chambermaid holds the door open for Ruchotte. Everything 
looks normal. She waits while he looks around. The bed is 
made. There is an untouched breakfast tray on the desk.
Her ipad charger is plugged into the wall socket but there’s 
no laptop or ipad in the room. Ruchotte makes notes.
INT. VILLA/STUDY - MORNING
Alex lifts his head off his desk, awakened by the smell of 
coffee that Mimi has laid out for him. He rubs his stiff neck 
and sees that she is reading the pages he’s written.
MIMI
It is a very romantic beginning, these 
two children floating in the swamp. 
‘ow did they get there?
ALEX
I don’t know. That was all I could 
come up with.
MIMI
I like it.
ALEX
Thanks.
She leaves him to it. He sips the hot coffee.
INT. PINK SUITE - DAY
Ruchotte sits with Gary and Lori.51."
"52.RUCHOTTE
Were there any problems that were 
troubling her that she spoke about?
GARY
Well, she’s got a very high stress 
job. There’s always something to 
complain about.
He forces a smile that goes unreturned.
RUCHOTTE
I see. And did she mention anything or 
anybody that was bothering her here in 
Cannes?
LORI
(spits)
Just that fucking claim-jumper.
RUCHOTTE
Pardone?
GARY
He was just looking for work.
LORI
He was fucking claim-jumping.
Gary shoots her a look. She angrily turns away.
RUCHOTTE
What does this mean, claim-jumping?
GARY
Nothing, it’s...
LORI
It’s bullshit. It means she promised 
the job to my husband and then she 
gave it to Alex. Which makes no sense 
cause she fucking hated him.
RUCHOTTE
Who is this Alex?
INT. VILLA - DAY 
Mimi straightens around the house. There is a KNOCK at the door. 
She answers. Detective Ruchotte stands there.
RUCHOTTE
Good morning, Madame. I am Detective 
Ruchotte of the Cannes Municipal 
Police. May I come in?52."
"53.Mimi allows him access. They step into the living room together. 
He takes in the grand space.
RUCHOTTE
You have a beautiful home, madame.
MIMI
Mademoiselle. I am the ‘ousekeeper.
RUCHOTTE
Francaise? Pardone. Your name is?
MIMI
Mimi Franchotte.
The conversation continues in French with occasional lapses 
into English.
RUCHOTTE
Ah, Mimi. Does Alex Lombard live here?
MIMI
This is his ‘ouse.
RUCHOTTE
It is incredible. What does he do?
MIMI
‘e is a screenwriter.
RUCHOTTE
Ahhh? He writes films? Any that I 
would know?
She shrugs. He notices the discolored line where the living room 
rug was.
RUCHOTTE
You have had your carpet removed?
He points to the straight line around the perimeter.
MIMI
Yes. There were wine spills from a 
party. It’s being cleaned.
RUCHOTTE
Fantastic. The good life, eh?
He notices the blank square where the painting once hung.
RUCHOTTE
You seem to be missing a painting 
as well. Is it also being cleaned?
She doesn’t respond to his joke.53."
"54.MIMI
How can I help you, Inspector?
RUCHOTTE
Detective. May I speak with your 
employer?
INT. VILLA/STUDY - DAY
Alex is working. Mimi raps gently on the door.
MIMI
Alex, there is a detective ‘ere to see 
you.
Alex stiffens for a second, but quickly composes himself. 
Ruchotte goes past Mimi and steps into the study.
RUCHOTTE
Monsieur Lombard, I am Detective 
Ruchotte of the Cannes Municipality.
ALEX
Come in, detective. Have a seat.
RUCHOTTE
Thank you.
Alex directs him into a chair.
ALEX
Can we bring you anything?
RUCHOTTE
No, no. I am fine, thank you. 
Alex shoots a “we’re okay” look at Mimi. She leaves. Alex rests 
on the arm of the chair opposite Ruchotte. 
THEY DON’T NOTICE MIMI EAVESDROPPING OUTSIDE.
ALEX
What can I do for you?
RUCHOTTE
We are trying to locate a woman, 
Gretchen Schotz. I understand she had 
dinner here two nights ago?
ALEX
Gretchen is missing?
RUCHOTTE
Possibly. Her partner is worried about 
her.54."
"55.ALEX
You know, she didn’t show up for a 
meeting we scheduled yesterday.
RUCHOTTE
Is that usual for her?
Outside the door Mimi tenses, hanging on every word.
ALEX
No way. She loves her work.
Ruchotte nods; thinks for a moment. Mimi starts to enter; stops 
herself when Alex answers.
RUCHOTTE
How was your relationship with this 
woman?
ALEX
Fantastic, we just started a new 
project.
RUCHOTTE
Monsieur, I have been told that this 
woman hated you.
ALEX
Well.. briefly. In that way that I’m 
sure, as a man, you’d understand.
Ruchotte nods again. Never takes his eyes off Alex who fights 
not to wilt under the scrutiny.
RUCHOTTE
So, there were amorous relations 
between you?
Mimi can’t take it; comes in.
MIMI
Alex, would you and your guest like 
some coffee?
ALEX
No, Mimi. Please. We’re fine.
He nods toward the door. She demures.
ALEX
I’m sorry. We had a relationship many 
years ago. When she was here the other 
night we had a good laugh about the 
old days and then we talked business.55."
"56.RUCHOTTE
And the other night, did she indicate 
that anything was upsetting her?
ALEX
No. She was positively ebullient.
RUCHOTTE
I’m sorry, What means, “ebullienne?”
ALEX
Extremely happy. Very up and positive. 
She was excited that we were going to 
be working together again.
Ruchotte nods, considers.
RUCHOTTE
I see. So why did she ‘ate you?
ALEX
She didn’t hate me. She loved me. She 
was you know, down for a while when we 
split up, but that was like ten years 
ago. Now she’s very happy that we’re 
going to be working together again. 
It’s a fantastic project.
Ruchotte nods; seemingly satisfied.
RUCHOTTE
Monsieur, you seem to know her well. 
What do you think happened to her?
MIMI TENSES, SHAKES HER HEAD, BE CAREFUL!
ALEX
I don’t know. She did seem a bit 
stressed. Maybe she went clubbing when 
she left here and found herself a nice 
young Frenchman.
Ruchotte considers.
RUCHOTTE
But you said she loves her work.
ALEX
Yeah. She’s very career driven. But 
who knows how much stress she’s under. 
She’s probably just blowing off a bit 
of steam. I’ll bet she shows up 
tomorrow.
RUCHOTTE
You think so?56."
"57.ALEX
I’m sure.
Ruchotte smiles coolly and as he turns to leave he smiles and 
tries a forced American accent:
RUCHOTTE
I’ll catch you later, maaan.
Alex squeezes out a smile. Ruchotte leaves, pleased with 
himself. Alex gropes for his valium.
EXT. CAFÉ - DAY
Gary and Lori sit at a small table.
LORI
You’re just gonna let this loser 
steal your job and not do anything?
GARY
What can I do? If Gretchen was 
around I could do something, but 
Alex and Antonio go way way back. 
This is fucked until she shows up.
LORI
It’s been two days.
GARY
Yeah?
LORI
That woman wouldn’t disappear in 
the middle of dealmaking season if 
God summoned her. Something very 
fucked up is going on.
GARY
Very fucked up, how?
LORI
It just doesn’t add up. She fucking 
hated him. She promised you the 
job. You already agreed on a deal. 
Now Alex shows up with your gig and 
she disappears into the ether?
Gary waits.
LORI
I think he killed her.
Gary grins.57."
"58.GARY
Come on! Alex is a puppy. Puppies 
don’t kill. They get run over.
LORI
He’s not a puppy. He’s an old dog. 
Old dogs bite. And if you’re not 
gonna do anything, I will.
She leaves. Gary starts to go after her then notices a STAR 
ACTOR ENTER. He waves and heads over!
GARY
Hey, Damien! What’s up, dude!
EXT. MARKET - DAY
Mimi takes her purchases to the counter. George the greengrocer 
raises an admonishing hand.
GEORGE
No more credit, Mimi.
MIMI
Don’t be stupid, George. I’m not 
marrying you.
GEORGE
No marriage, no credit.
MIMI
And no more customer. You blackmailing 
pimp.
George shrugs, that’s fine. Mimi shoves her produce into his lap 
and storms off.
INT. VILLA/STUDY - DAY
Alex tries to work. He’s torn between the thrill of having a job 
and the terror of being caught for murder.
ALEX
She wanted to destroy you, man. To 
take your home away.
(looks around)
My beautiful home.
He reflexively touches the wall, which momentarily galvanizes 
him.
ALEX
For once be a shark and not a whiny 
ass guppy. She tried to destroy you. 
She failed. She’s dead. I’m alive.58."
"59.He exhales deeply and refills his lungs, tingling with 
conflicting emotions. He looks out at the flowers blooming on 
his terrace and the sea beyond. Everything vivid and amazingly 
vital.
ALEX
Jesus, I can’t believe how great it 
feels to be alive.
He bounces back to his desk and begins scribbling notes.
EXT. COASTAL ROAD - DAY
Lori parks her rental car up the road from Alex’s drive. She 
stealthily trucks along and heads up the steep drive, 
continually peering over her shoulder.
INT. CANNES LUNCHEON - DAY
Antonio runs into CARLO DE LUCA, an ancient financier with his 
finger in many pies.
ANTONIO
Ça va, Carlo?
CARLO
Ça va, horseshit. I’m going crazy 
here, Antonio.
Antonio drops the continental accent.
ANTONIO
You and me both. Why the fuck are a 
couple of old bastards like us still 
trying to do this dance?
CARLO
Cause we like money, attention, and 
young pussy.
Antonio throws a conspiratorial arm round the old war horse.
ANTONIO
Not so loud, my friend.
CARLO
Hey, what is this I hear about 
Gretchen? She’s been kidnapped by 
Algerians?
ANTONIO
(with a wave of the hand)
She’s off having a fling. The poor 
girl needs some time away. I work her 
to death. What’s new with you?59."
"60.CARLO
I’m trying to put together a very fast 
deal, Antonio. I have a small window 
to use credit swaps out of Belgium. 
But I don’t have a property. Can you 
imagine, I have the money and no 
movie? On top of it one of my 
financiers wants us to work in a 
genius character who’s building some 
kind of high tech shit so he can put 
his gender neutral teenager in it.
Antonio practically licks his chops.
ANTONIO
Tell me how I can help, Carlo.
He links his arm inside Carlo’s and they go off to plot like 
old Roman consuls.
EXT. ALEX’S DRIVE - DAY
Lori crunches up the gravel, craning round to make sure she’s 
not seen. She steps on Gretchen’s broken iphone.
INT. VAILLARD’S RUG CLEANERS - DAY
Detective Ruchotte speaks with Vaillard, the owner.
RUCHOTTE
Are you cleaning a rug for the 
American who lives up on Cap Blanc?
VAILLARD
Oui, Detective. My son picked it up 
yesterday afternoon.
RUCHOTTE
Have you cleaned it yet?
VAILLARD
No. It won’t be done until tomorrow.
RUCHOTTE
Leave it untouched. I will send 
someone to pick it up.
VAILLARD
Monsieur, I don’t understand.
RUCHOTTE
It may be evidence. It may not. In any 
case, do not touch it until you hear 
from me.60."
"61.He leaves his card with the proprietor and exits.
EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE - DAY
Mimi crosses paths with Ruchotte. He greets her. 
RUCHOTTE
Bonjour, mademoiselle.
She nods curtly. He joins her stride. Notices the celery 
sticking from her shopping bag.
RUCHOTTE
You have been doing the marketing?
MIMI
You are quite a detective.
RUCHOTTE
(playfully)
Years of training.
They walk in silence for a while. Then:
RUCHOTTE
How do you like working for the 
American?
MIMI
(indifferent)
It’s a good job.
RUCHOTTE
Do you have a nice relationship with 
him?
MIMI
I suppose so. We never talk about 
politics.
RUCHOTTE
Very smart.
They walk some more.
RUCHOTTE
Your employer is a very attractive 
man.
MIMI
You are attracted to him?
RUCHOTTE
Mademoiselle, please. I am not that 
way.61."
"62.She stops and turns to him.
MIMI
What is it you want, Detective?
He tries his boyish charm.
RUCHOTTE
Does this have to be professional? 
It’s a beautiful afternoon.
MIMI
Monsieur, you obviously want to know 
something. Just ask.
RUCHOTTE
I have so many questions. 
(thinks; exhales)
What time did they make love?
MIMI
They made love?
RUCHOTTE
Of course. You knew that.
MIMI
I was in my own bed. Not ‘is. I cannot 
tell you anything except she didn’t 
eat my cassoulet.
RUCHOTTE
(incredulous)
She refused your cassoulet? I’m 
surprised you didn’t kill her.
MIMI
Detective, I’m sure there are other 
things you can be doing to find 
this woman besides checking on my 
shopping. If there are no more 
questions, I’ll say good-bye.
She turns to leave but something catches his eye and he takes 
her elbow. He turns her and stares at the small gash on her 
forehead.
RUCHOTTE
What happened to your head?
Mimi pointedly unlatches his hand from her elbow; stares into 
his eyes.
MIMI
Just the usual beatings ‘e give me 
if I’m late with his lunch.62."
"63.Ruchotte takes the dig. He nods politely. She turns and 
leaves the square.
EXT. VILLA - DAY
Lori peers through the windows. Sneaks round, peers through 
another window. She sees Alex at his desk. He pushes out his 
chair and goes to the window. She drops down; waits, frozen.
SHE CAN FEEL HIM INCHES ABOVE HER, staring into his garden.
The front door slams shut! Alex turns his attention. Mimi 
enters carrying the groceries.
Lori scurries away.
INT. VILLA - DAY
Mimi enters and finds Alex staring out the window.
MIMI
Alex, how is it coming?
ALEX
I’ve got nothing. I’m just. I don’t 
know. This stuff about Gretchen is 
really worrying me.
MIMI
You must put it out of your head, 
Alex. You ‘ave a job. You must 
perform.
ALEX
Mimi, if something’s happened to that 
woman, I’m the main suspect. She was 
here the night before she disappeared.
MIMI
Alex, if you let it stop you, then you 
look more suspicious.
ALEX
Well, I’m sorry, Mimi, but I just 
can’t turn on the creativity when I’m 
a murder suspect!
MIMI
Calm down, Alex. She’s just missing. 
There is no murder.
She gets pours him a small brandy. He obediently swallows.
MIMI
I am going to ‘elp you.63."
"64.ALEX
How are you going to help me?
MIMI
I will tell you what scenes to write 
and you write them down.
ALEX
Mimi, don’t be ridiculous, you’re not 
a writer. How are you going to dictate 
a story to me?
MIMI
Ah, it is not that difficult. All 
these love stories are the same. Pick 
up your pencil. I will talk. You 
write.
She sticks the pencil between his fingers.
ALEX
Mimi, this is crazy. You don’t even 
know what it’s about.
MIMI
The young pimp? Of course I know what 
it’s about. It’s the story of a boy 
who uses women until he meets the 
right woman.
It’s that simple. Alex is silenced. He regards her in a new 
light. There’s more here than he ever realized.
INT. VILLA/STUDY - DAY
Alex hits the printer button and three new pages slide out of 
the chute. The stack is getting larger.
INT. VILLA - DAY
Mimi answers a knock at the door. It’s Antonio.
ANTONIO
Hello. I am Antonio Leroy. The 
producer who Alex is working for. You 
are?
MIMI
Mimi.
She waits. Antonio takes in the villa.
ANTONIO
This place is beautiful. Is Alex home?64."
"65.MIMI
Yes.
ANTONIO
How is he doing? Is he happy with the 
pages?
MIMI
They are very good.
ANTONIO
You’ve seen them?
MIMI
Of course.
ANTONIO
What are they like?
MIMI
Very romantic. This Cajun pimp ‘e is 
very appealing.
ANTONIO
Timothée Chamalet?
MIMI
Easily.
ANTONIO
How many pages has he done? Is he 
making good progress?
MIMI
As good as can be expected. But the 
pressure it is too much.
ANTONIO
I know. I know. I wish... Is there 
anything that I could do to help?
MIMI
Oui, you could put some money in ‘is 
pocket. Why should ‘e worry about the 
bills and the police?
Antonio considers.
ANTONIO
I’ll see what I can do.
INT. VILLA/STUDY - DAY
Alex stares down at his pages. There is a gentle rap at the 
doorway. Alex turns to see Antonio lingering at the doorway.65."
"66.ANTONIO
Alex?
ALEX
Antonio, how are you? Come in.
ANTONIO
Alex, I’m sorry to disturb you. But I 
wanted to see how you were getting on.
ALEX
No problem, Antonio. Would you like 
some coffee?
ANTONIO
No. I’ll only stay a minute. How is 
everything?
ALEX
As well as can be expected. These are 
crazy circumstances.
ANTONIO
I know. I know.
ALEX
Has there been any word from Gretchen?
ANTONIO
Nothing. I’m beginning to fear the 
worst.
ALEX
We can’t let our fears overpower us, 
Antonio. All we can do is wait.
ANTONIO
Yes, you’re right. How are the pages 
going?
ALEX
Good. You know, all this crazy 
pressure just seems to turn up the 
creativity.
Antonio wants to say something, but he’s tentative.
ANTONIO
Listen, Alex, is it possible...
ALEX
No.
ANTONIO
But...66."
"(MORE)67.ALEX
Antonio, you know, I never show pages 
before a script is ready.
ANTONIO
But these are exceptional 
circumstances.
ALEX
They always are.
ANTONIO
Would you just let me finish, please?
Alex folds his arms and waits.
ANTONIO
I pitched the story to Carlo De Luca 
and he loved it. He says he can slip 
our picture in to some financing he’s 
got coming through Belgian tax 
credits. But I need the script. Fast. 
You could polish it along the way.
Alex throws him a “who are you kidding” look.
ALEX
If I turn in a second rate draft, 
you’ll have Gary sitting over my pages 
before I get out of the parking lot. 
Forget it.
ANTONIO
Okay, then come and pitch the story to 
Carlo. It’s your job as the writer.
ALEX
You just said you pitched him.
ANTONIO
I didn’t pitch, I titillated! Look, 
this is part of your job. If you can’t 
pitch to a financier maybe I should 
just get Gary to write the script.
Just like that - zip - slice - balls gone. Alex exhales.
ALEX
You got me there, Antonio.
Antonio pats his arm.
ANTONIO
Good lad.
(as he heads for the door)
(MORE)67."
"ANTONIO (cont’d)68.Oh, and work in something about a 
gender neutral teenager who’s 
building some high tech bullshit. 
One of the financiers wants it for 
his kid.
Alex stares incredulously as Antonio shuts the door behind 
him.
INT. ALEX’S STUDY - LATE NIGHT
Alex paces the floor and talks to himself. He stares at his 
3X5 cards, reading: Gender Neutral, Genius, Amazing 
Inventions.”
ALEX
(pitching to the cosmos)
It’s kind of like Elliot Page meets 
Val Kilmer in Real Genius but in a 
multiverse.
(helplessly shaking his 
head)
Whatever the fuck that means.
EXT. HOTEL/PATIO - DAY
Alex enters. Every table is packed with show biz types 
hustling projects and eyeing each other. Antonio immediately 
greets Alex, folds his arm in his and leads them across the 
patio.
ANTONIO
(conspiratorially)
Lose the gender neutral tech 
genius. Carlo just told me that 
financier’s dropped out.
As they pass a table, Mr. Visionary Director is pitching 
another prospect.
MR. VISIONARY DIRECTOR
It’s simple, we turn on the 
smartphone cameras of the entire 
audience without them knowing it...
Antonio leads Alex to Carlos’s table and does the introductions.
ANTONIO
Carlo, this is Alex Lombard.
CARLO
Alex, I’m a huge fan. Sit down, sit 
down. Are you hungry?ANTONIO (cont’d)68."
"69.Alex starts to refuse but before he can respond, Carlo waves 
to the waiter.
CARLO
Bring coffee.
(to Alex)
So what’s your take on the story, 
Alex?
Alex settles into his chair.
ALEX
It’s very simple, Carlo. This is the 
story of a young man who uses women, 
until he finds the right woman.
Carlo and Antonio exchange a nod, sounds good.
ANTONIO
Give us a little taste, Alex.
ALEX
Sure.
(readies himself)
We open on a moving shot looking 
straight up through moss-covered 
branches at the pale moon. We hear 
rippling water. But we still don’t 
know where we are. Then we reverse to 
the beautiful faces of two young 
lovers staring straight at the sky. 
They are floating on a raft through 
the bayou...
ACROSS THE PATIO
We see Gary and Lori eating by themselves. Miserable. They watch 
Alex bewitching Carlo and Antonio.
LORI
Look, honey, he’s pitching your story.
GARY
Would you fucking give it a rest.
She angrily grabs the ketchup bottle and smothers her burger.
TIME CUT:
EXT. MAJESTIC HOTEL/PATIO - DAY
Alex leans over the table now, bringing the story to a climax 
for Carlo and Antonio who are on the edge of their seats.69."
"70.ALEX
And we’re back to the beginning, on 
the raft with our two lovers staring 
up at the moonlight, and we realize 
the entire story has been told in 
flashback, and these two lost children 
are dying. And as they reach for each 
other’s hands, their eyes shut, and we 
tilt up to the moon through the 
Spanish moss and fade out.
Alex waits. Carlo and Antonio are mesmerized. Even the waitress 
is enraptured. The two producers look at each other and smile.
CARLO
I’ll see you two at the Academy 
Awards.
(holds his hand out to Alex)
Excellent job, Alex. I can’t wait to 
see the pages.
Antonio gives Alex the thumbs up.
BACK ACROSS THE PATIO
Gary and Lori watch the celebration. Not happy.
LORI
I’m gonna get that motherfucker.
Gary ignores her; swills his beer.
EXT./INT. CASINO BARRIÉRE - DAY
A massive complex with gaming tables, slot machines, 
restaurants and bars.
CLOSE ON THE BAR
A charge card is touched to the card reader. The name on the 
card is: GRETCHEN SCHOTZ. A woman’s hand retrieves the card.
The huge patio is packed with industry people making deals. 
CARLO DE LUCA, an ancient financier is at a table with a 
Saudi sheik and a Chinese financier. He spots:
A FLAMBOYANTLY DRESSED WOMAN WITH BOBBED HAIR
Crossing past the glass doors.
CARLO
Gretchen?
(to his colleagues)
Excuse me a moment.70."
"71.Carlo jumps up and spots her across the lobby.
CARLO
Gretchen!
She disappears. Carlo frustratedly goes back to his meeting.
INT. POLICE STATION - DAY
Ruchotte listens as a sloppy middleaged man animatedly talks 
and puckers his lips to mimic kissing.
INT. VILLA/STUDY - NIGHT
Alex waits anxiously while Mimi reads his pages.
MIMI
This pimp, ‘e must make some gesture 
to show ‘is devotion to ‘er.
Alex considers.
ALEX
Like Van Gough cutting off his ear?
MIMI
Yes, like that. But no ears. It’s too 
‘orrible. Very Ugly.
She gives a little shudder. Then, an idea hits Alex.
ALEX
There was this great movie years ago 
called The Yakuza, about Japanese 
gangsters. Robert Mitchum cuts off his 
pinkie to prove how sorry he is.
MIMI
‘is pinkie? What is ‘is pinkie?
ALEX
(wiggles his pinkie)
His little finger. It was very poetic. 
Robert Mitchum had unknowingly caused 
Takakura Ken immeasurable sorrow, 
something you can’t just say “I’m 
sorry” for. So in true Samurai 
tradition, he cuts off his pinkie, 
wraps it in a white handkerchief, and 
presents it as a sign of his sincere 
regret. It was very moving.
She thinks about it; nods.71."
"72.MIMI
I like this pinkie.
INT. VILLA/STUDY - MORNING
The villa is quiet. Alex sits at his desk staring off in 
frustration. He turns on his computer and tries to steal a 
neighbor’s internet signal. Nothing. Makes up his mind.
INT. VILLA/KITCHEN - MORNING
Mimi is busy. Alex bops through.
ALEX
I’m going to the library to use the 
internet. I’ll get breakfast in town.
Before she can say anything, he’s out the door.
INT. POLICE STATION - DAY
Ruchotte finishes a phone call at his desk. He hangs up and 
calls out to Detective OULETTE.
RUCHOTTE
Her charge card was used at Casino 
Barriére yesterday afternoon.
Detective OULETTE jokes with a few of the other detectives.
OULETTE
‘ow do you get an American woman to 
moan?
(he waits a beat)
You take away ‘er charge cards.
The detectives laugh.
RUCHOTTE
Why don’t you idiots shut up!
OULETTE
Ruchotte, we’re just having fun.
SECOND DETECTIVE
The Americans overreact to everything. 
They are too neurotic.
RUCHOTTE
And how are you going to react when 
this woman turns up dead?72."
"73.Ruchotte storms out. The detectives turn to each other and grin.
ANOTHER DETECTIVE
Some of the French are neurotic as 
well, eh?
OULETTE
He’s from Alsace. They are all 
Germans.
SECOND DETECTIVE
If she’s dead it’s from screwing too 
many Frenchmen.
They all laugh.
EXT. STREAM AT THE BOTTOM OF A DEEP CANYON - DAY
A young couple plays in the shallow stream. He splashes her. The 
girl pushes the boy into the water and runs off laughing. He 
chases her.
She speeds off, weaving between the dense foliage. She finds a 
thick cluster of trees and underbrush and ducks in. She 
playfully removes her wet shirt in anticipation of her soon to 
arrive lover. As she slides off her jeans, she looks up and 
SCREAMS WHEN SHE SEES --
GRETCHEN’S DEAD FACE STARING DOWN AT HER from behind the 
windshield of the wrecked Mercedes! The car is wedged into 
the trees just above the girl. Gretchen’s limp body is 
suspended in glass like she’s in a fish bowl.
CUT TO:
INT. CORONER’S OFFICE - DAY
CORONER examines Gretchen’s corpse. Ruchotte stands behind him.
RUCHOTTE
What can you tell me, Jean?
CORONER
I can tell you to hand me that saw and 
come back later.
Ruchotte passes over the tool and exits.
INT. VILLA - DAY
Mimi answers a knock at the front door. It’s Ruchotte.73."
"74.RUCHOTTE
May I come in?
She steps aside to allow him access. He enters.
RUCHOTTE
Where is your employer?
MIMI
‘e went to the library.
RUCHOTTE
We are alone?
MIMI
Would you like coffee?
He nods, thanks.
INT. VILLA/KITCHEN - DAY
Ruchotte and Mimi sit in awkward silence as he drinks his 
coffee. With each sip his eyes press into her. As he finishes:
RUCHOTTE
We found the missing woman’s body.
MIMI
Did you?
RUCHOTTE
You don’t seem surprised.
MIMI
Well, Monsieur Detective, you assured 
me that she was dead and that you 
would find her. So I am not surprised 
at all.
RUCHOTTE
I also said that your boss killed her.
MIMI
You can also be wrong.
RUCHOTTE
Why are you so sure?
MIMI
Because, ‘e is not a person who can 
kill people.
Ruchotte takes his last sip and rises.74."
"75.RUCHOTTE
Do you mind if I remove some hair 
samples from your employer’s closet? I 
could get a court order.
MIMI
‘elp yourself.
RUCHOTTE
Merci.
INT. VILLA/ALEX’S BEDROOM - DAY
Ruchotte removes hair strands from Alex’s closet. Mimi watches 
from behind.
RUCHOTTE
We both know he killed her. But do you 
know that your silence makes you an 
accessory to murder?
MIMI
Would you like one of my hair samples?
RUCHOTTE
No. I know you are just being used. I 
will find a way to help you. Au 
revoir.
He leaves.
INT. LIBRARY - DAY
Alex combs the internet for stories about Nita shooting her 
boyfriend.
He finds a small blurb: “domestic disturbance ends in shooting.” 
There are photos of Nita, her sultry mother, and a young 
Algerian man.
Alex scans but can’t seem to find what he’s looking for.
INT. VILLA - DAY
Alex comes home. Mimi is in the study when Alex enters.
ALEX
Hey, guess what I found out about 
Nita’s double homi...
Mimi’s serious expression stops him in mid-sentence.
ALEX
What happened?75."
"76.MIMI
They found Gretchen. She is dead.
Alex’s knees buckle. He grabs the back of the chair.
ALEX
Where did they find her?
MIMI
At the bottom of a ravine. Near 
Montaroux.
ALEX
Montaroux? How - I don’t understand. 
What was she doing there?
MIMI
They don’t know.
INT. POLICE STATION - DAY
Alex finds Ruchotte.
ALEX
Detective, my housekeeper just told me 
that you found Gretchen. Can you tell 
me what happened?
RUCHOTTE
Her car was found at the bottom of a 
deep ravine off the Montaroux road. 
It’s been there for several days.
ALEX
How come nobody found it sooner?
RUCHOTTE
It’s a very wild area. Nobody goes 
down there.
ALEX
But what happened?
RUCHOTTE
We are waiting for the medical 
reports.
Alex nods, doesn’t know what to say next.
ALEX
If there’s anything I can do to help, 
please let me know.76."
"77.RUCHOTTE
There is something... A witness saw 
you kissing the woman next to her 
car.
ALEX
Yeah. I kissed her good night. So?
RUCHOTTE
He described a very passionate 
kiss.
ALEX
What he described was a passionate 
hug. We were dear friends.
RUCHOTTE
Another witness saw her on her 
knees giving you a very passionate - 
how you say - blow job.
ALEX
(trying to stay cool)
On her knees, yes. But not very 
passionately. She dropped her car 
keys. Your witnesses have dirty 
imaginations. Show some respect for 
the dead!
Ruchotte doesn’t respond. An awkward moment.
ALEX
Is that all?
Ruchotte gives a barely perceptible nod. Alex retreats.
EXT. POLICE STATION -  DAY
As Alex gets into his Jaguar he notices a large envelope in 
his back seat. He opens it and finds Gretchen’s broken i-
phone is inside.
The note reads: “At least get rid of the evidence!”
Alex fearfully whips his head round. He gets in the car and 
quickly drives off.
EXT. COASTAL ROAD - DAY
As Alex drives along the shoulder, he flings pieces of the 
broken iphone over the cliff edge into the Mediterranean.77."
"78.INT. CORONER’S OFFICE - DAY
Ruchotte is with the Coroner.
CORONER
She had sex before she was killed.
RUCHOTTE
Do you know yet who she was with?
CORONER
I have a DNA match here.
He gets the report for Ruchotte.
INT. MAJESTIC HOTEL - DAY
Detective Oulette shows a picture of Gretchen to chambermaid.
MAID
No, that was not her. The woman I saw 
had darker hair.
Oulette notices Lori leaving her MAJESTIC HOTEL room and heading 
for the elevators.
OULETTE
Like her?
MAID
It’s possible. That looks more like 
her than this picture.
Oulette goes after Lori.
INT. VILLA - EVENING
Alex sits alone, trying to figure out who would have sent that 
message. There is a knock at the door. It is Ruchotte.
RUCHOTTE
Monsieur, we need to have a very 
private conversation. May I come in?
Alex tries not to show his terror.
ALEX
Yes, of course. Please, come in.
RUCHOTTE
We have proof that this was a crime of 
an intimate nature.
ALEX
Intimate. How do you mean?78."
"79.RUCHOTTE
There is no question the killer knew 
the woman.
Alex tries to look detached.
ALEX
He knew her? Are you sure?
RUCHOTTE
We have discovered evidence of sexual 
activity on the day of the murder.
A meek, “oh,” escapes Alex.
RUCHOTTE
I was hoping you and I could speak 
frankly together.
Alex keeps a facade of respectful attention but his resolve is 
weakening.
ALEX
I’ll do whatever I can, Detective.
RUCHOTTE
The victim, Gretchen, she had a 
very... conflicted love life.
ALEX
I, uh...
The pressure is building. A bead of sweat trickles down Alex’s 
cheek.
RUCHOTTE
She mixed business with pleasure too 
much.
ALEX
Detective, I couldn’t say...
RUCHOTTE
Just tell me the truth. What was 
between her and Gary Bergen?
ALEX
(blurts)
Okay, look...
(realizes, puts on the 
brakes)
Gary?
RUCHOTTE
He was your apprentice at one time. 
Yes? You knew them both intimately.79."
"80.ALEX
Gary?.. I didn’t know... anything was 
going on between him and Gretchen.
RUCHOTTE
Yes, that is who she was with before 
she was killed. I thought you might be 
able to tell me about their 
relationship.
ALEX
Their relationship? I’m stunned... 
I...
RUCHOTTE
You obviously know less than I do. I’m 
sorry to disturb you, monsieur.
ALEX
Oh, it’s no trouble. At all.
RUCHOTTE
Au revoir.
And Ruchotte is gone. Leaving a stunned Alex resting against the 
door. He looks heavenward, exhales a monumental lungful of 
relief and with a big smile goes back to writing his script.
CUT TO:
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT
Ruchotte questions Gary.
RUCHOTTE
Monsieur, we know that you ‘ad sex 
with the victim that day.
Gary shifts uneasily.
GARY

RUCHOTTE
We found a sample of your DNA inside 
the dead woman.
Off Gary’s horrified face:

picture. It’s so castable.
As he rides her from behind.
GARY
Let me tell you who’s gonna play Nita.
GRETCHEN
We don’t let writers near casting.
GARY
When I tell you, you are absolutely 
going to come.
GRETCHEN
Okay, I’ll play. Tell me. Come on, I 
live for this shit!
GARY
If you want it now, you gotta beg for 
it. Come on, baby, beg!
GRETCHEN
Tell me, you giant dicked demon, come 
on, give it to me! Give it to me!!!
GARY
Beg, baby!
GRETCHEN
Tell me! Tell me!!!
As he rams it into her:
GARY
Reese Witherspoon!
She stops in mid-thrust and looks round at him, mood broken.
GRETCHEN
She’s way too old.
Gary stares back, deflated, watches helplessly as Gretchen gets 
out of bed and begins straightening herself up.
GRETCHEN
I have another meeting.
He stares at her, deflated.
GRETCHEN
Come on, scoot. I’ve got to get 
changed.
CUT BACK TO:81."
"82.INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT
Detective Ruchotte stares down at Gary.
RUCHOTTE
Monsieur, this DNA sample you left 
behind, it looks very bad for you.
GARY
Yes, but... It’s old. Way old.
RUCHOTTE
Mon dieu, how old can it be?
GARY
Before dinner. That was the last time 
I saw her.
RUCHOTTE
She was killed around midnight. You 
can account for your time that 
evening?
GARY
Every second.
RUCHOTTE
I am going to give you a few moments 
to think about what you want to tell 
me. I will be back shortly.
Gary nods obediently. Ruchotte goes out and lights a cigarette 
and spots 
OULETTE QUESTIONING LORI IN AN ADJOINING INTERROGATION ROOM. He 
raps on the one-way glass. Oulette emerges.
RUCHOTTE
What are you doing?
OULETTE
I thought we should grill them at the 
same time. Like they do on CSI.
Ruchotte impatiently throws his hands up.
RUCHOTTE
Merde! You are all like children.
OULETTE
Come on. It will be fun.
Ruchotte shakes his head.
CUT TO:82."
"83.INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT
The writer sits nervously under the Frenchman’s glare.

time on the night of the murder? 
Especially around midnight?

Uumm, yes... I can.
INTERCUT:
INT. SECOND INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT
She is more composed than her husband.

So you were with somebody between 
midnight and two in ze morning?

Of course.
FLASHBACK TO:
INT. ROOM - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
Lori in her favorite position, on her back, in the middle of

meeting...

BACK TO:83."
"84.INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT
Ruchotte is finished with Gary. As they step out together, 
Gary leans in to the detective.
GARY
Can we keep this from my wife?
He turns to find himself face to face with Lori who’s just 
exited the other interrogation room.
CUT TO:
EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT
Ruchotte and Oulette smoke and mull over the evening’s events.
OULETTE
This American, he screws like a 
Frenchman, ay?
RUCHOTTE
And much more often.
They nod in agreement.
INT. CAB - NIGHT
Gary and Lori ride in silence.
LORI
Slimy prick.
GARY
Fucking slut.
What’s left to say?
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. VILLA/STUDY - DAY
Alex and Mimi work. He’s still fragile, but she’s cool; cracking 
the whip. THE PRINTER tops up the script halfway.
INT. ANTONIO’S SUITE - DAY
Antonio answers the door. Mimi carries an envelope under her 
arm.
ANTONIO
Ah, Mimi! Come in!84."
"85.She enters.
ANTONIO
Can I get you anything?
She shakes her head, no.
ANTONIO
Are those the pages? Let me have them.
She just holds out her hand with a snap of the fingers.
MIMI
First the money, s'il vous plait.
Antonio regards the tough woman. She’s good.
ANTONIO
Of course.
He produces his own envelope, holds it out with one hand, while 
the other gestures for the pages. Mimi doesn’t like the game. 
She reaches for the envelope. He doesn’t release it. Teases her. 
They tug and then he lets go with a playful chuckle.
MIMI
Enfant!
They both hungrily dig into the envelopes. Antonio begins 
reading the scene. Mimi counts the massive stack of bills.
While she’s counting, Antonio grunts and chuckles as he reads 
the pages. He’s happy. Finally:
MIMI
There’s only twenty thousand ‘ere.
ANTONIO
That’s all the cash I could find in a 
few hours.
Mimi thinks; tries a little charm.
MIMI
Are you ‘appy with the pages?
Antonio makes a pretense at aloofness.
ANTONIO
They’re not bad for a start.
MIMI
Yes, you’re right. It would be best to 
wait till ‘e ‘as finished the ‘ole 
script.
Antonio takes the bait.85."
"86.ANTONIO
(desperate)
Can you get me more pages? It would 
help me so much.
MIMI
Let’s ‘elp each other. 
ANTONIO
(catching on)
How would we do that?
MIMI
‘ow much cash can you give me if I 
bring you half of the script?
ANTONIO
He’s done half of it?
MIMI
Not yet. But perhaps by tomorrow.
ANTONIO
I can get maybe ten more tomorrow and 
the balance as soon as he delivers a 
completed script.
MIMI
Tres bien. I will come see you 
tomorrow.
Antonio nods; impressed. When she reaches the door:
ANTONIO
Mimi. What exactly do you do for Alex?
MIMI
I am ‘is ‘ousekeeper.
ANTONIO
Have you ever considered becoming his 
agent?
She exits.
EXT. MARKET - DAY
Mimi makes a big show of handing a fat wad of cash to George, 
who can only sheepishly hold his hand out.
INT. BANK - DAY
Mimi pays the mortgage.86."
"87.EXT. VILLA/TERRACE - AFTERNOON
Alex stares out at the afternoon sun over the sea. He has a fat 
glass of brandy in his hand. Mimi appears.
MIMI
Alex, is everything alright?
ALEX
Yes, Mimi. Everything is very... 
alright.
They stare out at the view for a moment.
MIMI
I have something for you.
He turns to her, expectantly. She leads him to the doorway; 
points inside.
Hanging on the wall is Alex’s favorite painting, back where it 
belongs. He’s stunned.
ALEX
Mimi, I don’t understand...
She hands him an envelope full of cash.
ALEX
What is this?
MIMI
Almost five thousand dollars. I paid 
the bills and deposited the rest into 
your bank account.
ALEX
How...?
MIMI
I made a deal with Antonio. ‘e paid 
cash for the opening scenes. 
ALEX
You gave him my pages? Mimi, I 
never...
MIMI
(cuts him off)
Now you do, Alex. You ‘ave no ‘eat and 
no more credit. I had to pay some of 
your bills. And now Antonio knows he 
has to pay in cash. So you won’t ‘ave 
to hear his lawyer tell you that the 
check is coming.
Alex is dumbstruck.87."
"88.ALEX
Thank you.
MIMI
You are welcome.
An awkward moment as he regards his amazing housekeeper.
ALEX
Would you have a brandy with me?
He holds up the bottle. She nods, okay. He pours her one. They 
drink. Watch the sky and the sea. He stares at her. She tries to 
ignore his gaze. Finally:
MIMI
What? Why are you staring at me?
He smiles, shakes his head.
MIMI
Tell me.
ALEX
It’s nothing. I just... I never 
realized...
MIMI
What?
ALEX
You were so... amazing.
She blushes. He takes another sip. Ponders.
ALEX
Mimi...
MIMI
Yes, Alex?
ALEX
Do you have anything nice to wear?
She self-consciously clasps the front of her blouse.
MIMI
Is there something wrong with my 
clothes?
ALEX
No. It’s just... I want to take you 
somewhere wonderful to celebrate. So 
go put on your best dress.88."
"89.She’s taken aback. He smiles. She returns it. Then goes off to 
change.
CUT TO:
INT. VILLA - LATE AFTERNOON
Alex waits in the living room, all freshly shaved and spruced 
up. Mimi enters wearing her dress. Alex takes her in, his eyes 
reveal horror, but he smiles politely.
ALEX
I have an idea. Come on.
He grabs her by the hand and yanks her out the door.
BEGIN MONTAGE - AFTERNOON THROUGH EVENING
The convertible heads for town with Alex at the wheel and Mimi 
beside him.
INT. ELEGANT CLOTHES SHOP - DAY
A shop girl shows Alex and Mimi some dresses. Mimi obviously 
loves them but doesn’t approve of the price. Alex covers her 
mouth and nods to the sales girl to wrap it up. He throws the 
money down and drags Mimi out with the new package.
INT. SHOE STORE - DAY
Mimi models a pair of expensive high-heeled pumps. Once again, 
she protests the price and Alex ignores her and pays.
EXT.SALON - LATE AFTERNOON
Mimi stops Alex from following her in.
MIMI
This is my cousin’s salon. You 
cannot come in and boss us around.
He starts to say something; and she waves the “silence” 
finger. He smiles. She goes inside.
INT. SALON - CONTINUOUS
Alex watches through the window as Mimi kisses her cousin and 
thrills her with a request for a full makeover. 89."
"90.As Mimi plops into the chair, Alex peruses the salon’s 
collection of vintage beauty product posters and a long row 
of wigs perched on mannequin heads, from the common to the 
more outrageous, and of course, the obligatory Anna Wintour 
bob. Alex shakes his head and walks to the square.
Mimi gets the full beauty treatment. Her eyebrows are plucked. 
Her nails are polished. Her face gets painted.
EXT. STREET - DUSK
Alex waits on a bench in the square. He looks up to see --
MIMI  
Absolutely radiant. A dazzling transformation from frumpy  
housekeeper to Audrey Hepburn. He takes her hand and gives her a 
twirl!
INT. RESTAURANT - EVENING
Mimi and Alex sit at the center table, basking in the glow of 
candlelight and attention from all around them. TWO SHIMMERING 
STARS.
EXT. STREET - EVENING
Ruchotte emerges from a bar and spots Alex and Mimi through the 
window. He watches the pair dining, laughing, raising their 
glasses, oblivious to his malevolent stare.
EXT/INT. VILLA - NIGHT
Alex and Mimi arrive home. An awkward moment. Neither know how 
to take the next step. Finally, he strokes her hair and says 
goodnight. She goes downstairs to her bedroom.
INT. VILLA/ALEX’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Alex goes up to his bedroom. Begins unbuttoning his shirt, 
goes to the window, watches below as her light turns on.
INT. VILLA/MIMI’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Mimi gets into her single bed. She turns out the light stares 
out the window up to the top of the house.90."
"91.INT./EXT. - ALEX’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Alex stares out his window down at Mimi’s darkened window, far 
below. Then he gets into his huge, empty bed.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. VILLA - MORNING 
Alex already at his computer, frustratedly staring back 
between his stack of notes and the keyboard. Blocked. The 
stack of pages is almost script sized.
ALEX
Who are these people?
Gets an idea. Grabs his car keys.
EXT/INT. ROAD TO MARSEILLES/CAR
Alex drives to Marseilles. It’s a gorgeous day.
INT. VILLA - MORNING
Mimi awakens. There is a glow to her after last night. She 
goes to the mirror, stares for a moment, puts on a touch of 
makeup.
INT. STUDY - MORNING
Mimi enters with a tray of coffee and croissants, LOOKING 
LOVELIER THAN USUAL. She is surprised to find that Alex is 
already gone.
INT. CORONER’S OFFICE - MORNING
Ruchotte angrily waves a lab report at the Coroner.
RUCHOTTE
Why didn’t you tell me this before?
CORONER
I just found out.
RUCHOTTE
What were you doing first?
CORONER
Analyzing the semen.91."
"92.RUCHOTTE
Why?
CORONER
Because everybody gets more excited 
over semen than dirty fingernails.
Ruchotte storms out.
INT. LAB - MORNING 119 119
Ruchotte leans on the lab guys.
RUCHOTTE
Where is the analysis of the rug 
stains?
LAB WORKER
It hasn’t come back yet.
RUCHOTTE
Nobody goes home until I have it.
Before the lab worker can respond, Ruchotte is gone.
EXT. MARSEILLES - DAY
Alex’s Jaguar is parked in a run down residential area.
INT. DUMPY HALLWAY - DAY
Alex knocks on a door. ANNETTE, a trashy woman with a black eye 
answers. This is Nita’s sultry mother. She sizes up Alex.
ANNETTE
Half and half. One hundred Euro.
ALEX
Are you Annette Grutzia?
ANNETTE
Who are you?
ALEX
My name is Alex Lombard. I’m a 
screenwriter. May I come in?
ANNETTE
No.
ZUZO
(o.s.)
Who is it, you stupid whore?92."
"93.Annette turns back into the apartment.
ANNETTE
An American, you piece of shit!
ZUZO, a slim young Armenian in his early twenties, also sporting 
a black eye, comes to the door. His picture was also in the 
story on the internet.
ZUZO
What do you want?
ALEX
Uh, I’m writing a movie about Nita and 
I was hoping to talk to you.
ZUZO
(face lights up)
You are making a movie about Nita? 
Please come in.
(to Annette)
Bring us some tea, stupid cow!
ANNETTE
I’ll put poison in it for you.
Zuzo ignores her and motions Alex inside.
INT. ZUZO’S APARTMENT - DAY 
Zuzo leads Alex into the cramped living area. They sit at the 
tiny table while Annette makes tea and warily eyes them.
ZUZO
You are going to put me in your movie?
ALEX
(can’t help but smile)
Well, actually I am.
ZUZO
Oh, that is wonderful. Will you pay me 
lots of money?
Annette plops two cracked mugs of tea on the table. She points 
at one.
ANNETTE
(to Alex)
Don’t drink that one. I filled it with 
rat poison.
Alex nods, thank you.93."
"94.ALEX
I have to say I’m very surprised to 
find you two alive.
ANNETTE
You should be surprised to see Nita 
alive. When I find her I will kill the 
stupid bitch.
ZUZO
Shut up and let the men talk.
She leans in the door jamb and lights a cigarette.
ALEX
Can you tell me what happened the 
night of the shooting?
ZUZO
The same thing that always happens 
with jealous whores.
ANNETTE
And little dicked men.
He furiously hurls his mug of tea at her. It smashes against the 
wall.
ZUZO
I said shut up or I’ll cut your 
throat, woman!
ANNETTE
You couldn’t cut yourself shaving, 
you...
She lets forth with a stream of Slavic vituperations. He jumps 
up. Alex grabs his arm.
ALEX
Please stop!
Zuzo obeys.
ZUZO
I am so sorry for being a bad host. 
ALEX
It’s okay. Please, you were telling me 
about the night of the shooting?
ZUZO
Oh, yes. I was having sex with the 
mother and the daughter walks in and 
begins shooting.94."
"95.ALEX
You were... I thought you were Nita’s 
boyfriend?
ZUZO
Yes.
ALEX
You were sleeping with mother and 
daughter?
ZUZO
(proudly)
Every day and night.
ALEX
Didn’t that create a certain amount of 
tension in the household?
ZUZO
Of course. Tension is good thing. No?
ALEX
Tell me, Zuzo, why were you sleeping 
with both women?
ZUZO
To keep control. If a man does not 
control women, then they control him.
ANNETTE
Ha, she had you wrapped around her 
little finger.
ZUZO
I’m warning you, bitch. It’s not 
too late to cut your tongue out.
Alex sees something vulnerable in Zuzo. He steps in between 
Zuzo and Annette.
ALEX
Tell me, for the movie, did you 
love Nita?
Zuzo remembers, almost smiles.
ZUZO
Nita was special. She knew how to 
manipulate a client. But seeing the 
true person was the way she did it. 
Those bitches are hard to find.
Annette catches him savoring the memory of her daughter; fires a 
lamp across the room. It catches Zuzo on the side of the head. 
He goes down. She jumps on him and starts punching. They roll 
around the floor, pummeling each other. Alex watches in horror.95."
"96.The rolling and pummeling soon turns to passion and Zuzo and 
Annette lock in a hot embrace. Alex lets himself out.
INT. VILLA - DAY
Mimi answers the door. It’s Ruchotte.
RUCHOTTE
Where is Alex?
MIMI
Oh, now you call ‘im by ‘is first 
name? You ‘ave become friends?
RUCHOTTE
Mimi, I don’t want to arrest you. But 
I have enough to make a case against 
your boss. And I will force you to 
testify. Think about that. The end is 
coming very quickly. Make your 
decision.
He turns and gets into his car. She watches him drive off.
EXT. ROADSIDE CAFE - DUSK
Alex calls Mimi. She is frantic.
ALEX
Mimi, you’re not gonna believe who I 
just spoke to...
MIMI
Alex, where are you?
ALEX
In a cafe just outside of Toulon. I 
should be back in about an hour.
MIMI
Don’t come home!
ALEX
Mimi, what’s wrong?
MIMI
Ruchotte was here! ‘e ‘as evidence 
against you.
ALEX
What? What kind of evidence?96."
"97.MIMI
I don’t... Alex, you are in big 
trouble! Listen carefully. I need you 
to meet me...
EXT. DARK STRETCH OF ROAD - NIGHT
Mimi waits. A lone car approaches, slows to check her out. Then 
keeps driving. It’s getting a little creepy.
Then Alex’s jaguar pulls up. Mimi gets into the car and it pulls 
away.
INT. GREEN JAGUAR - NIGHT
Mimi rides beside Alex.
MIMI
Alex, you’ve got to get away from 
here!
ALEX
What happened?
MIMI
Ruchotte came to the ‘ouse. He said he 
is going to arrest you for Gretchen’s 
murder.
ALEX
He’s just trying to scare you.
MIMI
No. He has been trying to scare me the 
whole time. This is different. He has 
some new evidence. And he said he will 
make me testify!
Alex pulls the car over. He turns to face her.
ALEX
Listen to me, Mimi.
She waits, watching his face. He doesn’t know how to say it. 
Finally:
ALEX
I killed her.
She stares into his eyes, reading him.
ALEX
It was an accident, Mimi. But that 
doesn’t change anything. I killed her.97."
"(MORE)98.MIMI
But, Alex... You... ‘ow did it ‘appen?
He runs an anxious hand through his hair.
ALEX
What does it matter? We got into an 
argument. She punched me in the face 
and we fought.
MIMI
She punched you?
ALEX
Yes. And then she started choking me.
MIMI
Choking?
ALEX
She had some kind of Minnesota police 
training or something. I was blacking 
out and I hit her in the head with my 
Guild award. 
MIMI
What did you do with her body?
ALEX
That’s the freaky thing I just can’t 
figure out. I left her by her car. But 
they found her body over on the 
mountain road to Montaroux.
MIMI
I don’t understand.
ALEX
Neither do I, Mimi. Somebody planted 
her in her car and dropped it off a 
cliff.
They sit in silence for a long time. Mimi gets out of the car, 
stares off, thinking. He gets out and comes over to her, waits.
MIMI
Listen to me, Alex. You’re not 
thinking clearly. If somebody moved 
her body to Montaroux it means they 
killed her.
ALEX
I killed her. She had no pulse.
MIMI
Ah, Alex, you are not a doctor! You 
think you killed her! 
(MORE)98."
"MIMI (cont’d)
(MORE)99.But you can’t be sure. Dead bodies 
don’t drive their cars off cliffs! 
Something else happened and we have 
to hide you until we find out.
ALEX
If I disappear everything’s going 
to come down hard on you.
MIMI
When they question me, I will say we 
were sleeping together when the murder 
‘appen.
Alex is taken aback.
ALEX
I don’t want you to lie for me, Mimi.
She looks right into his eyes, determined.
MIMI
I will lie for you. If they make me 
testify, I will say that we were 
together. I don’t care what you say 
now.
Alex takes a few steps away, some realization of his internal 
irony elicits a smile. 
ALEX
(to himself)
This is the story of a man who uses 
women until he finds the right 
woman.
MIMI
What, Alex?
As he comes forward to face her.
ALEX
(still smiling)
I’m just a bit slow.
He forms his next thought, carefully.
ALEX
You wouldn’t have to testify if we 
were married.
She is taken aback. He gently takes her hand.
ALEX
Listen to me. If we’re married at 
least the house belongs to you. MIMI (cont’d)
(MORE)99."
"ALEX (cont’d)100.You can collect my Guild benefits. And 
nobody can make you testify.
MIMI
But, Alex...
ALEX
Mimi... in many ways we’ve been 
married for years. We just slept in 
different rooms. If you don’t want to 
sleep in the same room as me that’s 
okay. But at least you’ll have the 
house. And you’ll be protected.
MIMI
(can’t find the words)
Alex...
ALEX
Will you marry me, Mimi?
She’s always wanted to hear this, but now she is overwhelmed.
MIMI
Of course I will.
He touches her face, with more tenderness than he could ever 
express. They stare for a breathless moment and slowly their 
mouths come together for the LONGEST, SWEETEST KISS.
INT. TOWN HALL - DAY
Mimi and Alex go through the marital red tape in a small town 
office. The Clerk is obviously a bit out of sorts by the rule 
bending. But his desk plaque reads: “Arnon Franchotte.” Mimi’s 
cousin.
EXT. RUSTIC RETREAT - NIGHT
Hidden deep in the hills of Provence.
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
Alex and Mimi are alone. It’s bit awkward. Alex doesn’t know 
quite how to play it. He stares at the bed. Pats it.
ALEX
One bed.
He rearranges the pillows. Pats the bed again. He turns the 
bedside lamp on. A bit too bright. He turns it off. He goes 
to the window, opens the curtains to let in a bit of 
moonlight. ALEX (cont’d)100."
"101.Mimi watches as he adjusts the curtains, trying to create the 
perfect ambience.
MIMI
What are you doing?
ALEX
It’s our honeymoon. I’m, you know, 
trying to set the mood.
Mimi reaches into her bag and pulls out his laptop, notepad and 
printer.
MIMI
There will be time for an ‘oneymoon, 
later. You must finish the script.
Whip cracked. The marriage begins.
CUT TO:
INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT
Oulette runs up to Ruchotte clutching some paperwork.
OULETTE
I just got the lab report. They found 
two blood types on Lombard’s carpet. 
His and Gretchen Schotz’s.
Ruchotte smiles cruelly. He’s got him!
RUCHOTTE
Let’s bring him in.
They go to gather up their colleagues.
INT. RUSTIC ROOM - NIGHT
Alex writes. Mimi brings him coffee. Reads over his shoulder. He 
smiles up at her. Almost finished.
EXT. VILLA - NIGHT
Ruchotte tries to find Alex but the house is empty. The jaguar 
is gone from the garage.

Detectives fan out and search for Alex.101."
"102.INT. RUSTIC ROOM - NIGHT
Alex types away while Mimi sleeps on the divan.
INT. PARTY ROOM - NIGHT
Antonio, dressed in a tuxedo, is pulled aside and questioned by 
Ruchotte. Antonio shakes his head adamantly.
INT. RUSTIC ROOM - DAWN
A bleary eyed Alex watches as the final page slides out of 
the printer. Mimi racks the script and smiles at him.
EXT. SMALL QUIET HARBOR/DOCK - MORNING
Mimi makes a call at a phone booth.
INTERCUT WITH:
INT. ANTONIO’S SUITE - MORNING
Antonio’s in bed. He tries to rub some life into his hungover 
face. Nita sleeps beside him.
ANTONIO
Hello?
MIMI
It’s Mimi.
Antonio jumps anxiously.
ANTONIO
Mimi, where are you? The police are 
looking everywhere for Alex!
MIMI
We went away to finish the pages.
ANTONIO
Are they ready?
MIMI
Do you ‘ave the money?
ANTONIO
Yes, yes. Is it ready? You have no 
idea how much is riding on this 
script!102."
"103.MIMI
I have it in my hands.
Antonio’s eyes bug out greedily.
ANTONIO
Thank God! I’ll pick it up from you 
right now!
MIMI
No. You have to go to the bank.
ANTONIO
I have the money with me!
MIMI
You’ll have to get more. The price 
just went up.
ANTONIO
Mimi, you’re joking. 
MIMI
I don’t joke, Antonio.
ANTONIO
If I don’t deliver today I lose my 
financing!
MIMI
The banks open in fifteen minutes.
Antonio’s face says it all. She’s got him by the balls.
EXT. SMALL QUIET HARBOR - MORNING
Mimi hangs up. Walks down to the end of the dock where Alex is 
loading supplies on to a small fishing boat. “Mer du Franchotte” 
is painted on the transom. This is the same boat we saw in the 
opening. She thanks her Uncle Claude, the fisherman who owns the 
boat. He kisses her cheek and rides off on his bicycle. 
MIMI COMES ABOARD AND TRIPS OVER A LINE ON THE BOAT; LOOKS DOWN 
INTO THE MESS IN THE HOLD.
MIMI
Ah, ‘e never finish anything.
With a shake of her head she goes into the hold to tidy up.
CUT TO:103."
"104.EXT. CROISETTE - DAY
Amid the crowds of film fans and tourists, Oulette and his 
colleagues watch the streets.
INT. ANTONIO’S SUITE - DAY
Antonio goes to the door. Mimi is there.
ANTONIO
Mimi. Come in.
MIMI
I don’t ‘ave time, Antonio. Get me the 
money.
ANTONIO
Of course.
He fetches an envelope from his briefcase and hands it to her. 
She sees it’s filled with cash, shoves it into her bag and hands 
him the script.
ANTONIO
You’re not going to count it?
MIMI
I trust you, Antonio. Enjoy the 
script.
ANTONIO
Thank you.
She turns to leave and a HAND REACHES THROUGH THE DOOR AND GRABS 
HER WRIST. It’s Ruchotte.
Mimi’s eyes flash angrily at Antonio.
ANTONIO
I’m sorry, Mimi.
RUCHOTTE
Don’t be. You were terribly close to 
being an accessory yourself.
INT. HALLWAY - DAY
Mimi tries to pull away. Ruchotte closes the door behind him so 
they are alone in the hall together.
RUCHOTTE
You, on the other hand, are an 
accessory. And I will give you one 
chance to save yourself. Where is he?104."
"105.She stares at him defiantly, but says nothing.
RUCHOTTE
Can you really be that stupid?
MIMI
Yes.
Ruchotte becomes angrier. But he quickly composes himself.
RUCHOTTE
We found traces of his blood and her 
blood in the carpet he sent for 
cleaning.
FLASHBACK TO:
INT. VILLA/LOUNGE - DAY 
Alex as he left for his meeting.
ALEX
Mimi, could you have the rug cleaned? 
I spilled some wine on it last night.
BACK TO:
INT. HALLWAY - DAY 
Ruchotte sees she is vulnerable. He pours it on.
RUCHOTTE
Do you know what he did to that woman? 
I’ve just seen the medical report. She 
was horribly beaten.
Mimi doesn’t respond.
RUCHOTTE
But she fought back. We found clumps 
of Alex’s hair in her fists and his 
blood under her fingernails. It was 
quite a battle.
FLASHBACK TO:
INT. VILLA/LOUNGE - NIGHT - MIMI REMEMBERS
The bruise on Alex’s throat. She remembers that night, watching 
the fight and Alex knocking Gretchen out.105."
"106.WE SEE MIMI WATCHING THE BATTLE THROUGH THE SLATS IN THE WINDOW.
BACK TO:
INT. HALLWAY - DAY 
Mimi looks up to Ruchotte. He bends her to his will.
RUCHOTTE
Where is he?
She bows her head. Defeated.
MIMI
‘e is leaving on my brother’s boat.
RUCHOTTE
Take me to him.
He grabs her by the wrist and leads her to his car.
INT. RUCHOTTE’S CAR - DAY
Ruchotte drives, smug and superior. Mimi sits beside him. 
Silent.
EXT. DOCK - DAY
Alex waits. Nervous. Can feel something is wrong. Checks his 
watch. Should he leave?
EXT. RUCHOTTE’S CAR - DAY
Speeds along the twisting coastal road.
EXT. DOCK - DAY
Alex can wait no more. He takes a last look up the road and hops 
on to the boat.
EXT. DOCK - DAY
Ruchotte’s car screeches up. Too late. Alex has set off.  
Ruchotte jumps out of the car and races down the dock.
RUCHOTTE
Stop!
Mimi follows. As Ruchotte reaches the end of the dock, MIMI 
STOPS, REMEMBERS:106."
"107.EXT. SMALL DOCK - MORNING - FLASHBACK
Mimi arrives at the boat, loaded with groceries for a long 
boat trip. SHE TRIPS OVER A LINE AND SHAKES HER HEAD.
She goes into the hold of the ship; checks the multiple fuel 
cans that feed the engine. They are all full and connected 
together. 
She removes the caps, GAS VAPOURS BEGIN HISSSING. Then she 
loosens the pipe connecting the tanks to the engine and we 
see gas slowly dripping from the pipe onto the engine casing.
CLOSE UP on MIMI. A satisfied expression of “That will do it” 
comes across her face.
BACK TO:
EXT. BOAT - MORNING
Alex smiles easily with the wind in his face. Suddenly, smoke 
begins billowing from the hold. Alex is enveloped.
EXT. DOCK - DAY
Ruchotte finds a motor boat. He jumps in and as he tries to 
get it started --
ALEX’S BOAT EXPLODES, hailing debris over the dock.
A BLACKENED LUMP TUMBLES FROM THE SKY AND LANDS AT RUCHOTTE’S 
FEET!
The tiny object catches Ruchotte’s eye. He curiously picks it 
up.
He examines the small, charred digit. Behind him, we CLOSE IN 
ON MIMI, inscrutable, just the hint of Mona Lisa on her lips.
RUCHOTTE’S VOICE
I’ve never seen such an explosion.
CUT TO:
INT. POLICE STATION - MORNING
Ruchotte recounts the details to his rapt colleagues.
RUCHOTTE
The only piece we could find to 
identify his body was this.
He holds up a BLACKENED PINKIE FINGER.107."
"108.OULETTE
I have to admit, we were wrong about 
you.
ANOTHER DETECTIVE
He figured out the whole thing before 
anyone knew she was dead.
The Detective holds up the newspaper and SLAPS THE HEADLINE 
STORY, proclaiming “local detective solves Hollywood murder!”
RUCHOTTE
Two people knew. The killer. And 
myself.
A THIRD DETECTIVE
Come on, Ruchotte, rub it in our 
faces.
RUCHOTTE
(brags)
I could smell the first time I walked 
into his house that there was a murder 
there.
He inhales deeply for effect.
FLASHBACK TO:
INT VILLA/LOUNGE - NIGHT
Mimi allows Ruchotte into the house. He notices the missing 
carpet.
THE FIGHT BETWEEN ALEX AND GRETCHEN
That culminates in her crumbling limply to the carpet.
RUCHOTTE’S VOICE
It was obvious he killed her in his 
home.
EXT. VILLA/DRIVE - NIGHT
We see a replay of Alex carrying her body down the drive.
RUCHOTTE’S VOICE
Then, he brought her body to the car.
As he explains, we see THE REAL DETAILS OF WHAT REALLY HAPPENED 
THAT NIGHT:108."
"109.EXT. VILLA - NIGHT 
As Alex retreats back up the drive--
We see MIMI WATCHING WIDE-EYED FROM THE UNDERBRUSH. Alex runs 
up the hill.
After a while, she sees Gretchen wake up and pull herself out of 
the ravine. Mimi glances round, then runs over to the woman.
RUCHOTTE’S VOICE
And off he drove with her.
INT./EXT. CAR - NIGHT - MOVING
Mimi helps Gretchen into the passenger seat. Produces the keys 
and drives them off.
MIMI
Are you okay?
GRETCHEN
No, that mutherfucker cracked my 
skull!
MIMI
Just be calm. I am going to... take 
care of you.
GRETCHEN
Where are you going? Cannes is that 
way.
She points in the opposite direction.
MIMI
I am taking you to a ‘ospital.
GRETCHEN
I’m not going to some French 
socialized medical shithole. I don’t 
need a goat doctor, I need the fucking 
police!
Mimi shrugs and turns the car up into the hills as a mist rolls 
in from the sea.
RUCHOTTE’S VOICE
He knew exactly where to take her.
CUT TO:109."
"110.EXT/INT. MOUNTAIN ROAD/MERCEDES - NIGHT
Mimi drives. Gretchen’s face is twisted with visions of 
revenge. The road is thick with fog.
GRETCHEN
Oh, I can taste this, honey, I can 
really taste it. A nice little charge 
of rape and aggravated assault should 
toast his croissants.
MIMI
You want to put him in jail?
GRETCHEN
No. I want to see him on the street. 
I’m going to take everything he owns, 
including his precious villa.
(off her look)
That’s right. He’s gonna give me his 
house to keep himself out of prison.
MIMI
Isn’t that blackmail?
GRETCHEN
In the states we call it an out-of-
court settlement.
They ride in silence. Gretchen glances over at Mimi.
GRETCHEN
What? Alex didn’t teach you how 
Americans roll? We live for 
revenge.
MIMI
You were really in love with him.
Gretchen remembers; her mouth twists.
GRETCHEN
Almost as much as I hate him now.
MIMI
I understand.
Gretchen regards her; reads her face.
GRETCHEN
You’re in love with him.
Mimi doesn’t answer.110."
"111.GRETCHEN
And you’ve gotten nothing for it, 
except what, washing his stinky old 
underwear? That fucking prick could 
always get a woman to powder his 
balls.
MIMI
How can you hate him so much now?
GRETCHEN
That’s where love goes. It always 
turns to poison.
They ride in silence for a while.
GRETCHEN
Listen... at first I thought you were 
a real dumb French bitch, hitching 
your wagon to that total loser. But 
hey, I’m not a monster. I’ll give you 
a job - you know, cleaning and shit - 
on a trial basis. I mean, providing we 
can share the same space.
Mimi pulls the car alongside the shoulder with a clump.
GRETCHEN
What’s wrong? Do we have a flat?
Mimi turns off the headlights and gets out. She leans into the 
car, inches from Gretchen’s face.
MIMI
No. We can’t share the same space.
She yanks the gear into first. A FROZEN MOMENT AS SHE AND 
GRETCHEN LOCK EYES! THEN, THE CAR LURCHES!
THE MERCEDES TUMBLES INTO THE CANYON!
RUCHOTTE’S VOICE
Then he dumped the car into the 
Montaroux ravine. He knew it would 
be days before anybody found it.
Mimi stealthily trots off down the road through the fog.

MIMI REMEMBERS:
WALKING TO THE MARKET AND DISCOVERING THE BROKEN CELLPHONE. SHE

When the maid dropped off the 
breakfast...
INT. GRETCHEN’S ROOM - LATER
Lisette brings in the breakfast tray and lays it on the bed.
RUCHOTTE’S VOICE
It was Alex covering his face and 
disguising his voice.
WE SEE MIMI IN THE BATHROOM PUTTING ON THE GRETCHEN BOB WIG, 
THANKING THE MAID. THE MAID SMILES WITH A CERTAIN FAMILIARITY.
RUCHOTTE’S VOICE
That is why the maid told us she had 
such a horrible voice.
As the maid lets herself out we see her name tag: LISETTE 
FRANCHOTTE! 
BACK TO:

Ruchotte finishes his story for the awed cops.
RUCHOTTE
Now I must say goodbye to all of you 
poor fools. I am off to a better life.112."
"113.The other detectives crowd him, patting his back and shaking his 
hand. 
He leaves. A few of the detectives follow him out, patting him 
on the back. Proud.
EXT. POLICE STATION - MORNING
As Ruchotte steps out with the other detectives surrounding him.
OULETTE
You have amazing instincts, Ruchotte.
He hands Ruchotte the newspaper as a souvenir.
RUCHOTTE
That is why I am being moved up to 
Paris and you simple peasants will 
stay here in this country precinct. 
Because you couldn’t spot a killer if 
he was living next door to you.
Ruchotte gazes proudly down at the article. ZOOM IN AND WE 
SEE THE BYLINE IS: REMI FRANCHOTTE. 
THE MOMENT IS BROKEN AS A BERETED BICYCLE RIDER ZOOMS PAST 
RUCHOTTE.
And THE RIDER heads up the hill carrying a letter in his basket.
CLOSE ON THE LETTER IN THE BASKET
It is from the Writers Guild. Addressed to Mrs. Alex Lombard.

Mimi wakes up in the master bedroom
Her breakfast is brought to her on a tray. The letter from the 
Writer’s Guild sits on a silver plate.
She opens the letter and gazes down at a benefit cheque made out 
to Alex Lombard’s widow. She tosses the cheque on to the tray 
and smiles.

"114.EXT. THE CANNES FESTIVAL - NIGHT - ONE YEAR LATER
Closing ceremonies. Stars and competition winners emerge from 
the theater and descend the red carpet.
Behind the barriers, fans applaud, flashbulbs erupt.
Carlo DeLuca heads a procession with a trophy bimbo on his arm. 
Behind him comes Antonio, arm in arm with Lori! The new power 
couple. They wave and smile.
Here comes Gary with Nita at his side. He clutches a winner’s 
statuette.
And finally, descending the red stairs like film royalty --
MIMI, LOOKING ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS, ELEGANT FINGERS WRAPPED ROUND 
A GOLDEN STATUE FOR BEST SCREENPLAY, HER CHANEL BAG IN HER OTHER 
HAND. She smiles and waves as her procession heads for their 
limos.
PAN THE BARRICADES 
Fans applaud and cameras pop. Stop at one pair of 
enthusiastically clapping hands and see that --
A PINKIE IS MISSING FROM THE MAN’S LEFT HAND. And we tilt up to 
find a nattily attired Frenchman with a full beard and wild, 
grey hair, wearing sunglasses and a cocked beret. Smiling and 
applauding furiously. He looks familiar.
AS MIMI STEPS INTO A BENTLEY LIMOUSINE, PINKIE MAN JAUNTILY 
TROTS OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BENTLEY AND SLIDES IN 
BESIDE HER.
                     THE END114."
