"FADE IN:
INT. KOLKATA - RESTAURANT - NIGHT 8.1 8.1
A MIDDLE AGED SINGER finishes up a Bengali song. Scattered 
polite claps from his audience at the restaurant.
Sitting somewhere in there - SHUKLA JI, a government employee 
type, in his 50s. Along with him - his ANNOYING WIFE.
A WAITER stands taking the order from the lady.
SHUKLA’S WIFE
Sarson ka tel toh nahi daalte na? 
(to Shukla)
In bangaliyon ke khaane mein yeh 
badi problem hai...
Shukla ji just sits there looking at her. Bored.
SHUKLA’S WIFE (CONT’D)
Aur ek sabzi paneer mein kar do. Par soft nahi hua toh waapas bhej doongi, haan...
The Waiter notes it down with a tired sigh, and walks away.
Just then - her phone rings. She answers.
SHUKLA’S WIFE (CONT’D)
(into the phone)
Haan Jyoti... arey main toh 
kalkatta aayi hoon inke saath...
(makes a face)
Theek hai. Hamaare Lucknow waali 
baat kahaan...
Shukla ji sits looking at her - utterly, utterly bored.
ON THE STAGE
: The Singer announces the next song he’s going 
to sing.
BAR SINGER
(in Bengali)
And this one goes to every bleeding 
Bengali heart out there...
The ORCHESTRA BAND starts with the initial beats.
Shukla ji picks up his cigarette and lighter lying on the 
table and gets up."
"SHUKLA’S WIFE
(cupping the phone)
Elaichi kha ke aana... poore dinner 
smell aati rahegi nahi toh.
Shukla ji gives her another tired, dull look. And turns 
around and walks away.
INT. KOLKATA - RESTAURANT - SMOKER’S LOUNGE - NIGHT 8.2 8.2
The O.S. orchestra band can be faintly heard here.
Shukla ji enters in, tries to light up a cigarette. But the 
lighter won’t work.
He looks around. Spots - a WOMAN. Very beautiful, very 
fragile - the kind you want to hold and comfort.
She seems disturbed as she furiously writes something on a 
paper napkin, while smoking a cigarette.
SHUKLA JI
Ji lighter milega?
She puts her lighter by her side, without even glancing at him.
He comes closer to pick it up. Notices her writing. Curious – 
he peeps in. It’s in Bengali.
She turns. Notices him looking. And then, almost like in 
anger, she crumples her page.
SHUKLA JI (CONT’D)
(embarrassed)
I... I am sorry. Wo kya hai na... kabhi main bhi likhta thha...
She looks at his boring babu-like demeanour from top to bottom. 
She scoffs, and goes back to her cigarette.We STAY ON her as she takes a long drag. And then she hears – 
SHUKLA JI (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Thodi tu tooti si,
Thoda main toota sa...
Surprised - she turns to look at him. 2."
"SHUKLA JI (CONT’D)
Raat teri jaagi si,
Din mera sota sa, Thodi tu roti si,Thoda main rota sa...Hai duniya se tu khafaa,Main khud se rootha sa,Thodi tu tooti si,Thoda main toota sa...
Their eyes meet. We can see - there’s a connection beginning to happen there.
SHUKLA JI (CONT’D)
Ho jaaye yun kabhi,Mil jaaye tu kahin,Fir tu bhi poori si,Fir main bhi poora sa...
And then - silence. Pregnant with possibilities. Shukla ji smiles.
SHUKLA JI (CONT’D)
Ab aap ki baari...
She looks at the crumpled paper in her fist. Consciously, she straightens it.
Then looks him in the eye. He smiles again – encouragingly.O.S., the song picks up tempo. And just as she starts to 
recite her poem, the door to the lounge opens. And the saccharine VOCALS from outside take over.
Chirodini tumi je aamaar, aami tomar juge juge...TITLE APPEARS - BLACK WIDOWOPENING CREDITS
EXT. CHITRAKOOT - ROAD LEADING TO RALLY MAIDAAN - MOVING 8.3 8.3
VEHICLES - DAY
A cavalcade of cars passes through while the SECURITY 
APPARATUS tries to keep the huge crowd on both sides at bay. *
The wily BALKISHAN BAJPAYEE, 60s, waves at the crowd from atop a jeep.
He bends over to accept a garland from an OLD LADY.Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 3."
"OLD LADY AT THE RALLY
Kaa re Bajpayee, je baari 
helicopterwa na laayo?
BAJPAYEE
Dhoti pehno hoon amma. Ud jaati toh saaro khel kharaab ho jaato.
The crowd laughs. Clearly, they love him. Someone lets out a war cry -
MAN AT RALLY
Arey Dalit ke dil ka raja kaisa?
The crowd knows how to respond.
CROWD AT RALLY
Jiji jaisa Bajpayee jaisa...
The cavalcade trudges on. Watching it go by - 
Hathi Ram, standing beside PRESS PHOTOGRAPHERS and REPORTERS.
CHITRAKOOT REPORTER ONE
Bajpayee ji ki jhaanki nikali hai 
Chitrakoot mein, par Gwala bhai nadaarad? Chakkar kya hai bhaiyya?
Hathi Ram listens on with interest.
CHITRAKOOT REPORTER TWO
Bajpayee ji se khud hee poochh lena. Dopahar ko press conference mein...
CHITRAKOOT REPORTER ONE 
In se kabhi koi seedha jawaab mila hai? Bramhan dev hain bhaiyya... jalebi khaate hain, jalebi hagte hain, aur jalebi jaisa sochte hain. Toh jawaab bhi waisa hee milega. Fir pakadte raho poonchh uski.
The two laugh.
EXT. CHITRAKOOT - RALLY MAIDAAN - DAY 8.4 8.4
The larger than life cut-outs of Jiji and Bajpayee adorn the 
huge maidaan.
ON THE STAGE
:
Bajpayee holds center stage.4."
"BAJPAYEE
Amreeka ke jungalon mein Black 
Widow naam ki ek makdee paayi jaati hai. Black Widow, yaani ki kaali vidhwa. Ye apne premi se sambhog karne ke baad usey maar ke khaa jaati hai.
Hathi Ram wades his way to the head of the crowd, looking for someone. 
He dials a number - Amitosh. No one answers.Meanwhile on stage, Bajpayee goes on -
BAJPAYEE (CONT’D)
Mere bhai, ae mere Dalit bhai, 
bacho uss Black Widow se, us party se jo aaj apne aap ko tumhaara premi bataa rahi hai. Election tak sambhog karegi, uske baad khaa jaayegi tumhe wo, jaise musalmaan bhaiyyon ko khaa gayi...
The crowd CLAPS.
Hathi Ram reaches the press enclosure. The goonish looking 
PARTY WORKERS stop him.
PARTY WORKER
Aage sirf media.
Hathi Ram scans the press enclosure. Spots – Amitosh.
HATHI RAM
(shouts)
 Amitosh! Amitosh!
Amitosh turns. Notices - Hathi Ram waving at him.
Amitosh - taken aback. His eyes go to - the Party Workers. 
They’re eyeing him suspiciously.
Amitosh tenses up. Tries to get out of the crowded press 
enclosure from the other side.
Hathi Ram notices him getting away, and goes after him, as *
behind on the stage, Bajpayee continues his speech - *
BAJPAYEE *
Mere Dalit bhai, samjho apne *
mahatva ko. Tum koi sadharan vyakti *
nahi ho. Arey tum toh kevat ho. *
(MORE)Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 5."
"Wo kevat, jisne apni naav pe bitha *
ke kshatriya samrat Prabhu Shri Ram *
ko Ganga paar karwaayi thhi. Tumhe *
kisi ke sahaare ki zarurat nahi, *
balki unhe tumhaari zarurat hai... *
Amitosh makes a dash. Bumps into a camera tripod, almost 
toppling it. The CAMERAMAN abuses. But Amitosh doesn’t stop.
Hathi Ram - on his tail.Amitosh gets out of the press enclosure and blends in with 
the crowd.
While continuing to run, he glances back. Seems like he has 
managed to shrug Hathi Ram off his tail.
But just then – Hathi Ram appears right in front of him.Amitosh realises it too late and runs right into Hathi Ram. Amitosh’s bag falls to the grounds - his note book, voice 
recorder, pens etc spilling out.
Amitosh quickly recovers, tries to gather his stuff back.Hathi Ram helps him out. As he hands over Amitosh’s notebook 
to him - 
HATHI RAM
Police ko dekh ke aise toh bas chor hee bhagte hain, Amitosh.
Amitosh looks at him sharply. And storms away from there.
Hathi Ram watches him go. And then we notice something hidden 
in Hathi Ram’s hands.
It’s Amitosh’s press card.
INT. NEWS NOW OFFICE - SANJEEV’S CABIN - DAY 8.5 8.5*
Someone touches his I-card on the scanner and enters - 
The Conference Room - packed to the brim. Additional chairs 
have been brought in to accommodate the employees. An informal open house in progress.
Several topics on the white board. Sanjeev leads.
SANJEEV
Okay, what else?BAJPAYEE (CONT'D)
Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 6."
"Someone chimes in.
JOURNO IN CONFERENCE ROOM
New caste equations for the UP 
elections.
SANJEEV
Sure.
He adds it to the already long list on the white board.
SANJEEV (CONT’D)
That should be good for the next week’s slate. Pratima?
Sitting across the table from Sara - her boss Pratima.
PRATIMA
Er, I think we can squeeze in one more...
Sanjeev’s eyes go to - Sara and Rohan, sitting next to each other.
SANJEEV
Maybe we should let the interns pick the last one. Er, Rohit?
Rohan - caught off-guard.
ROHAN
Sir, Rohan.
SANJEEV
Right. You got something for us, Rohan?
With all eyes on him, a nervous Rohan goes blank.
Sanjeev presses on - fixing him with a hard gaze.
SANJEEV (CONT’D)
Come on. Give us something. Twenty 
tips for a great Tinder profile, maybe.
The room laughs. Rohan - embarrassed.
Sara’s eyes meet Sanjeev’s. He’s enjoying this.
SARA
Fake news. Rohan had mentioned his 
friend who works in one of those fake news factories. 
(MORE)7."
"You should tell them about it, 
Rohan.
(beat)
Sounded like a story to me, specially given the UP elections.
Sanjeev stares at her. Sara stares back with defiance.
The room murmurs in support of the idea.Sanjeev turns around and adds ‘FAKE NEWS’ to the white board 
in all capitals, almost angrily.
EXT. CHITRAKOOT - CIRCUIT HOUSE - DAY 8.6 8.6
One of those old government circuit houses.
POLICE and PARTY WORKERS check press cards of JOURNALISTS and 
PHOTOGRAPHERS before letting them in. 
In the queue - Hathi Ram. Hanging around his neck - Amitosh’s 
press card.
When his turn arrives, Hathi Ram holds his press card in a 
way that the picture of Amitosh is half covered.
The Policeman glances at it cursorily and moves on to the 
next.
EXT. CHITRAKOOT - CIRCUIT HOUSE - OPEN COURTYARD - DAY 8.7 8.7*
Bajpayee on the dais. Photographs being clicked. Videos being 
recorded.
Hathi Ram sits with the rest of the press invitees. The 
reporter we met earlier at the rally asks a question.
CHITRAKOOT REPORTER ONE 
Sir kya hum yeh maan lein ki Chitrakoot ki sthaniya raajneeti mein naye samikaran ban rahe hain?
BAJPAYEE
Srivastav yaar, bade tedhe sawaal poochhte ho tum...
Everyone laughs.
CHITRAKOOT REPORTER ONE
Toh sir fir ek seedha saadha sawaal. Is saal Chitrakoot ka ticket kise diya jaane waala hai?SARA (CONT'D)
Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 8."
"BAJPAYEE
Dekhiye atkalein lagaane ya unhe 
badhaava dene se mujhe hamesha parhez raha hai. Do chaar dinon mein chunaavi list aa jaayegi. Sab waise hee saamne ho jaayega.
CHITRAKOOT REPORTER TWO
Pichhle kuchh elections ke vote share dekhein toh aap ki party ka Chitrakoot mein vote share nirantar girta raha hai. Is baare mein aap kya kahenge?
For once, creases appear on Bajpayee’s forehead. He pauses to sip some water.
Hathi Ram’s eyes go to - a man in the wings, behind Bajpayee.  
We’ve met SHUKLA JI before in the Episode header.
Shukla signals to a pretty FEMALE ASSISTANT. We know her too 
from the Episode header.
She hurries up to him with a bunch of files and papers.Shukla quickly sifts through them.ON THE DIAS
: Bajpayee struggles to come up with a satisfying 
answer.
BAJPAYEE
Dekhiye, ye utaar chadhaav toh laga *
hee rehta hai... mere rajnaitik *
jeevan mein pehle bhi aise kayi *
mauqe aaye gaye, main inhe bahot *
zyaada tavajjo nahi deta hoon... *
IN THE WINGS : Shukla finds what he’s looking for. As he 
plucks the paper out -Hathi Ram’s eyes remain fixed on the Female Assistant. 
Something familiar about her.
ON THE DIAS
:
Shukla approaches Bajpayee and hands over the paper to him, 
whispering something in his ears.
Bajpayee glances at the paper and nods. And then drops his 
defensive tone -
BAJPAYEE (CONT’D)
Aur maana ki hamaara vote share gira hai. 
(MORE)Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 9."
"Par ye kisi virodhi party ko nahi 
gaya hai. Ye kuchh nirdaliya ummeedvaaron mein banta hai. Doosri partiyon aur hamaare vote share ke beech ab bhi utna hee faasla hai...
Hathi Ram’s curious eyes go back to the Assistant as Shukla joins her back in the wings.
As a reporter asks another question in the meanwhile - *
CHITRAKOOT REPORTER ONE *
Sir kya aapki party Dalit Samaaj *
Party chunaav mein gathbandhan ke *
saath utaregi yaa aapne akele ladne *
ka faisla kiya hai? *
The Assistant notices something on Shukla’s shirt. A thread. 
She picks it off the shirt.
Shukla and her eyes meet. A smile.Hathi Ram continues to look at her with interest.
EXT. CHITRAKOOT - CIRCUIT HOUSE - LOBBY - DAY 8.8 8.8*
Bajpayee and his entourage walk down the corridor, towards *
another wing of the Circuit House.
Behind - the press reporters start to file out too.Hathi Ram’s one of them. His eyes keep a track on - Shukla 
and the Female Assistant rushing after Bajpayee.
He goes after them - but a CONSTABLE stops him.
CONSTABLE AT CIRCUIT HOUSE
Aage residence area hai. Yehaan 
allowed nahi hai. Chalo...
HATHI RAM 
Kaun kaun se sir ruke hain yehaan?
CONSTABLE AT CIRCUIT HOUSE

(MORE)Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 10."
"Naam yaad nahi aa raha unka, kya 
toh thha...
The cop looks at him with a hint of suspicion.
CONSTABLE AT CIRCUIT HOUSE
Kaun ho bhai? Bade jigyaasu ho.
Hathi Ram beams a smile - 
HATHI RAM
Patrakaar.
He turns around and walks away. Something on his mind!
INT. SANJEEV’S HOUSE - DINING AREA - DAY 8.9A 8.9A*
Felicia, the Mehra household help, opens the door.
A tired but excited Dolly enters in with bagfuls of shopping.Felicia helps her put them down on the table.Dolly goes through the bags, trying to find something. We see 
canine food, pet toys, dog shampoos, and what have you. Finally she finds what she is looking for - 
A dog coat that says ‘Mommy to be’.She looks at it with pleasure and walks with it to -
INT. SANJEEV’S HOUSE - HARMONIUM ROOM - DAY 8.9B 8.9B*
DOLLY
Baby look what I got for -
She stops in her steps as she looks at the pregnant bitch 
Savitri. The poor thing is yelping and whimpering in restlessness. (Note: Can be handled O.S. as well with sound)
Dolly takes a moment to realise what’s happening. And then 
she calls out with alarm - 
DOLLY (CONT’D)
FELICIA!
Felicia comes rushing to her side.
DOLLY (CONT’D)
Store mein se blankets le ke aa... Jaldi!HATHI RAM (CONT'D)

"Felicia rushes out.
Dolly is all nervous energy as she herself rushes to get the 
‘nesting box’ that she just shopped for.
She goes back with it to the room.Puts the box down in a corner.Felicia enters back with the blankets.
DOLLY (CONT’D)
Is pe bichha achche se spread kar 
ke... aur AC kam kar.
(to the bitch)
Don’t worry baby, we’ll be fine.
Savitri the bitch continues to whimper.
As Felicia gets down to spreading the blankets, Dolly rushes 
out again.
She picks up the phone. And quickly dials a number, nervous 
and excited -
DOLLY (CONT’D)
Hello, Dr Dalal?
EXT. CHITRAKOOT - CIRCUIT HOUSE - ROAD OUTSIDE - DAY 8.10 8.10
Early evening. Hathi Ram waits outside, keeping an eye on the Circuit House gates.
TWO COPS stand duty. A few party vehicles parked outside. Not 
much activity otherwise.
And then Hathi Ram spots someone walking out of the gates. 
It’s the Female Assistant.
She gets into one of the waiting cars. And the car drives 
away.
Hathi Ram jumps into Babua’s Vikram.
HATHI RAM
Chal, peechhe le iske.
EXT. CHITRAKOOT ROADS - MOVING VEHICLE - DAY 8.11 8.11
The Ambassador cruising on the roads.12."
"Behind - Babua rides his noisy-as-hell Vikram at top speed to 
keep pace with the Ambassador.
HATHI RAM
Silencer lagwaane par speed kam ho jaati hai kya?
Babua lets out a sheepish grin.
EXT. CHITRAKOOT HOTEL - DAY 8.12 8.12
A budget hotel. The Ambassador comes to a stop outside it.
The Assistant steps out of it and goes in.A little behind - the auto comes to a stop too. Hathi Ram jumps out and follows her, while trying to appear 
discrete.
INT. CHITRAKOOT HOTEL - LOBBY + ELEVATOR + STAIRCASE - DAY 8.13 8.13
Hathi Ram reaches the lobby. Looks around. 
Spots - the Assistant getting into an elevator.Hathi Ram rushes after her.He reaches there just in time, but only to realise - It’s packed.He watches in frustration as the doors shut on him.Hathi Ram looks around. Spots - the staircase. 
INT. CHITRAKOOT HOTEL - LOBBY + STAIRCASE + CORRIDORS - DAY 8.14 8.14
Hathi Ram rushes up the stairs.
He reaches the first floor. But - the lift’s on its way up.Hathi Ram runs further up the stairs.Second floor. The lift hasn’t stopped there either.By the third floor, Hathi Ram’s panting.And then as he turns around a corner - WHAM!13."
"He runs into a WAITER carrying a food tray. And both Hathi 
Ram and the waiter go tumbling down, while the crockery crashes on the floor.
The Waiter stares at Hathi Ram angrily, but Hathi Ram just 
gets up and runs up the stairs.
He reaches the FOURTH FLOOR, breathing hard. And rushes to 
the elevator - 
Just in time for the doors to open.People step out of it. But the Female Assistant is not one of 
them.
Shit. Hathi Ram realises his mistake. Rushes down the stairs 
again - this time just about managing to avoid the Waiter cleaning up the broken cutlery.
THIRD FLOOR. Hathi Ram walks out into the corridor to find it 
- empty. No one in sight.
Shit.Hathi Ram kicks at the wall in frustration. Then leans on to 
the wall, trying to catch his breath.
He stays there for a while. Then slowly gets up.With dejected steps, he walks back to the lift. It’s on the 
ground floor now.
Hathi Ram presses the button. Waits for it - his breath still 
laboured.
Finally the lift comes to a stop on his floor. The doors 
slowly open.
And standing in front of Hathi Ram - is Shukla ji. Hathi Ram - 
taken aback for a moment.
Shukla looks at him and steps forward. Hathi Ram realises. 
Steps aside.
Shukla walks out into the corridor.Hathi Ram waits there - pretending to tie his shoelaces.Shukla walks up to a door. Then looks around once. And 
knocks.
Soon, the door opens. A female hand pulls him inside. And the 
door shuts again.14."
"Hathi Ram gets up and walks up to the door. It’s room 317.
INT. CHITRAKOOT HOTEL - RECEPTION - DAY 8.15 8.15
The RECEPTIONIST. Hathi Ram walks up to him.
HATHI RAM
Ek kamra chahiye. *
RECEPTIONIST
Sure, sir. Yehaan entry kar dijiye.
He puts a register in front of Hathi Ram.
Hathi Ram starts to fill the details - but his eyes are 
looking for something else.
Finally he spots - the entry for room 317. The name the room 
is booked under - ‘Chanda Mukherji’.
Hathi Ram stops. Something about that name that rings a bell 
with him. Hathi Ram tries to think.
Hathi Ram quickly takes out his pocket diary. Flips through 
it.
And there it is – ‘Chanda’. In connection with Chaaku.And then an IMAGE flashes in front of his eyes - Chaaku’s 
tattoo. With the ‘C’.
And then another IMAGE comes to fill the whole screen – the 
half-visible picture of Chanda from Chaaku’s phone, her hand naughtily covering half her face.
INT. DINGY ROOM - DAY 8.16 8.16
FLASHBACK
:
The IMAGE from above UNFREEZES as CHANDA takes her hand off 
her face.
And we are certain now - it’s the Female Assistant.We see her from someone’s POV - laughing, fooling around. Chanda the beauty. Chanda the tease.
CHANDA
(play-acting)
Arey! Ye ‘C’ kyun likhwaaya haath 
pe? C for?Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 15."
"CHAAKU (O.S.)
Cat.
Chanda looks at him with naughty eyes.
CHANDA
Meow.
CHAAKU (O.S.)
Apni meow ke liye kuchh bhi kar 
sakta hai ye kutta.
Chanda comes close to the O.S. figure. And bats her pretty eyelid.
CHANDA
Kuchh bhi?
CHAAKU (O.S.)
Kuchh bhi.
She comes further close. And whispers huskily -
CHANDA
Kuchh bhi?
Just as the figure leans in to kiss her, we CUT TO -

The silence of the barracks, despite dozens of inmates in *

The Guard stops to look at him.
CHAAKU (CONT’D)
Koi milne aaya kya? 
The guard snorts. And walks away.Chaaku shouts back after him -Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 16."
"CHAAKU (CONT’D)
Bhai koi aaye toh bataa toh dena... 
bhai...
The guard is gone but from somewhere, a PRISONER shouts out – *
PRISONER *
Koi nahi aayega chutiye. Is hafte *
ki mulaqat khatam. *
Chaaku just stands there - holding the bars tight. Moments pass. And then - Chaaku bangs his head on the iron bars. Hard.
He then lets out a wild SCREAM. And slumps on to the floor on 
his knees.
And starts to sob. *
Tyagi sits in meditative pose - listening to Chaaku’s sobs. *
As it continues, a flicker of emotion appears on his normally *
stoic face. *
And then for the first time, he speaks out aloud - like he’s *
talking to Chaaku, but also to himself. *
TYAGI *
Ghabra mat! Masterji ne kahi thi... *

He plays the Video again.

MOCK INTERVIEWER ONE (T.V.) (CONT’D)
What do you have to say about the 
current status of minorities in this country? Do you see a change in the last few years?
We notice Ansari in the video, shifting in his seat - a little conscious.
ANSARI (T.V.)
Sir, if the question is - ‘are minorities feeling threatened in this country?’, then I’d like to say I think so. But is it a recent phenomenon? Probably not. If you -
The Interviewer pauses the video again.
MOCK INTERVIEWER ONE
Look Imran, when answering a politically loaded question like this, it’s important to come across as positive... progressive.
(beat; awkward)
Er, khaas kar ke tumhaare liye...
Ansari looks at him - equally awkward. And nods.

Chanda and Shukla embraced in the throes of passion.Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 19."
"Chanda has her arms and legs wrapped around Shukla who 
thrusts rhythmically, his janeu tied to his ear.
And with every thrust, Chanda whispers in Shukla’s ear a 
Bengali line. It’s the Bengali version of the poem we heard in the Episode header.
CHANDA
(in Bengali)
Prohor shesher ranga alo, *
Shedin choitro mash, *
Tomar chokhe dekhechilam... *
Shukla lets out one final thrust.
CHANDA (CONT’D)

The two hold on to each other - tight. In the eyes of both of them - tears of pure love and joy.

Evening descends on the road outside the hotel. An Ambassador 
parked there.
A figure emerges out of the hotel gates, glances around once, 
and gets into the car.
It’s Shukla. As seen from the POV of - Hathi Ram. *

sheet around herself and rushes to the door.
She opens the door with a naughty smile -
CHANDA

Only to see – Hathi Ram standing there.Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 20."
"Chanda - startled. Tries to shut the door back - but Hathi 
Ram stops it with a firm hand.

A flash of anxiety crosses Chanda’s face. But she recovers quick enough.
CHANDA
Kaun Tope Singh?
HATHI RAM
Chaaku. Jisne ‘C for Chanda’ khudwaya tha apne haath pe.
CHANDA
Mujhe nahi pata aap kya baat kar rahe hain...
He just stares at her. Chanda decides to go on the offensive.

Hathi Ram flips out his phone, threateningly -

Chanda makes a last attempt to present a brave face.

CHANDA
Pyaar karti hoon unse. Mili toh sirf ye jaanti thhi ki wo ek poet hain. Baad mein pata chala ki wo itne bade aadmi ke liye kaam karte hain...
HATHI RAM

CHANDA
Maine Shukla ji ko sirf apni problem bataayi thhi, sir. Fir dedh do maheene pehle Shukla jee ne mujh se kahaa ki Chaaku ko ek kaam ke liye manwa loon.
Hathi Ram looks surprised.
HATHI RAM
Kaisa kaam?
Chanda - silent.
HATHI RAM (CONT’D)
(shouts)
Kaisa kaam?
A scared Chanda blurts out.
CHANDA
Dilli ke ek hotel mein kisi Tyagi se milna tha aur uske saath rehna tha kaam poora hone tak. Unhone kahaa ki Chaaku uske baad mujhe tang nahi karega.
Hathi Ram - stunned at this revelation.25."
"She looks at him – Very vulnerable. And very beautiful.
CHANDA (CONT’D)
Mujhe nahi pata wo kaam kya thha. 
Uske baad maine Chaaku ka photo TV pe dekha... us case mein... Sachchi mujhe isse zyaada kuchh nahi pata sir.
Hathi Ram watches as she breaks down like a little girl. She does look very fragile at this point.
In all the crying, the bedsheet around her slips a little. 
The cleavage shows.
Hathi Ram – trying hard to not look at it. But it’s 
difficult.
She notices it too. And covers herself. She gets up. And slowly approaches him.
CHANDA (CONT’D)
Sir, mujhe nahi pata main kis game 
mein fans gayi hoon. Please mujhe bacha lijiye.
Hathi Ram’s eyes go to – that mole on her chin. And her quivering lips.
She looks him in his eyes.
CHANDA (CONT’D)
Please Sir. Mujhe ye sab kuchh nahi 
chahiye... main sirf jeena chahti hoon, maa baba ke liye kuchh karna chahti hoon...
She steps further close. Hathi Ram can’t help look at – her flawless neck, the bra strap around her smooth shoulder.
She takes a step further. She’s really close to him now.
CHANDA (CONT’D)
Mujhe bacha lijiye sir. Aap jo 
kahoge main karoongi...
For a moment – Hathi Ram seems to be slipping.
Slowly – the bedsheet begins to slip.And then – she lets it drop. She stands there - only in her 
undergarments, looking at Hathi Ram with rabbit eyes.26."
"That’s it. His expression changes. He stares at her.
HATHI RAM 
Pata hai ek minute ke liye maine 
tere pe bharosa kar liya tha...
He turns to walk away towards the door. But Chanda clutches on to his arm. 
CHANDA
 Sir please sir...
He tries to shrug her off. She clings on, getting dragged along with him.
Finally – He pushes her hard on to the bed. And walks away in 
disgust, slamming the door shut behind him.
She remains lying on the bed. Crying. Looking genuinely 
vulnerable once again.

Hathi Ram turns him around and points his gun at him. Only to 
realise – it’s Amitosh.
Hathi Ram stares at him with disbelief.

Amitosh tenses up and tries to cover his face - but the bike 
harmlessly drives past them.
Hathi Ram looks at his nervous state.

"But don’t worry, it’s not love. I 
think we both know it. It’s not friendship either. Our boss – subordinate status ensures that. That leaves us with ‘fuck’. So what you’re basically saying is – can we still be fucking even though I’ve started finding you obnoxious?
Sanjeev looks at her sharply.
And just then someone emerges from inside the bedroom. 
It’s Rohan. He too’s surprised to see Sanjeev. And then *
tentatively asks Sara -

EXT. JAMUNA PAAR POLICE STATION - NIGHT 8.47PC 8.47PC *
An agitated Ansari paces up and down outside the station. *
ANSARI *
(into the phone) *

toh kuchh gadbad lagi. Toh maine wo record us Chaaku ke paas se jo peela phone mila thha usse match kiya.

and speaks in a hushed tone. *
ANSARI (CONT’D) *
Match hai, sir. DCP Bhagat arrest *

Hathi Ram reaches the lane. There it is - Babua’s auto, parked in a corner. He rushes towards it.
ANSARI (CONT’D) *
Chakkar kya hai sir? Agar intelligence ke paas in chaaron ki information pehle se thhi toh arrest kyun nahi kiya?Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 42."
"HATHI RAM
Ye poora operation ek set up thha, 
Ansari. Aur Sanjeev Mehra ke murder attempt mein asli target Sanjeev Mehra nahi thha. Target ye chaaron thhe.
A stunned silence from Ansari’s side.
Hathi Ram reaches the auto. He jumps into it, and taps on 
Babua’s shoulder.
HATHI RAM (CONT’D)
Chal, Babua.
Babua turns to look at him. His face - pale.
Before Hathi Ram can understand – two figures step out of the 
corner. Their guns - pointed right at Hathi Ram.
It’s Om ji and Firangi, Gwala Gujjar’s dangerous goons.The two walk up to Hathi Ram’s auto from either side. And 
peep in - leering.
Hathi Ram - unable to make a move. Ansari’s O.S. voice can be *
heard coming from the phone - *
ANSARI (O.S.) *
(off the phone) *
Hello? Sir? Hello? *
Firangi pulls out Hathi Ram’s gun from behind his back. And 
grins at Hathi Ram.
And then - in a flash - Firangi puts the gun on Babua’s 
temple, and shoots.
BANG! Babua goes down like a fallen tree.Hathi Ram sits stunned at the back of the auto - his face 
splattered with Babua’s blood. Trapped.
FADE OUT.Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 43."
