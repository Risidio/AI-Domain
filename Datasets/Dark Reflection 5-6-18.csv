"EXT. THE DEEP BAYOU - DAY
Rays of sunlight stab through the Mangroves and Spanish Moss. 
Brown water laps sluggishly at the rotten wooden planks of a 
swamp shack's porch.
An arm undulates in the water, a washed out stump where the 
hand should be.
A local, DEPUTY MARCUM, shows the corpse to a pair of 
detectives, CLYDE STROM AND REMI THURSTON.
The head is missing from the body of a young man wearing only 
tight jeans.
REMI
Think dis boy noticed dat a gator was 
taking off his head?
CLYDE
Not likely.
Clyde shows his partner the dope track marks on the dead man's 
arm. Remi looks around, spots a needle and drug bag on box.
Their attention is distracted by the SOUND OF A CAR PULLING 
UP behind the shack. They wait, anticipating the FOOTSTEPS 
CRUNCHING THE GRAVEL and then --
DETECTIVE EDUARDO CASTRO steps on to the porch. Castro's a *
commanding presence with a good, weathered face, He nods to *
the two cops and surveys the scene. *
CLYDE
No need for da A Team, Eduardo. We *
just hafta start teaching junkies not 
to nod off on the end of docks.
Eduardo ignores him; crouches down to look at the body. Remi *
and Clyde get bent out of shape.
REMI
Castro, don't go making dis nothing *
more den what it is.
EDUARDO *
What's that, Remi?
REMI
A goddamned fool who shot too much 
dope 'n got his head bit off.
EDUARDO *
How do you figure that? *
CLYDE
See da rig right there by his rocker?"
"Points to the drugs by the rocking chair.
CLYDE
He passed out an' a big ol' gator 
tore his head off. Look at dem tooth 
marks.
He runs his finger along the torn neck sinew.
EDUARDO *
Clyde, you're laying on the porch and *
a gator grabs your head, what's going *
to stop you from getting pulled in *
the water?
Clyde looks to Remi for help.
REMI
Hell, a big ol' gator give a sharp 
tug and...
(snaps his finger)
Pinch dat head right off.
EDUARDO *
And these bruises? *
Eduardo points to the bruises along the corpse's back and *
upper arms.
CLYDE
Shit, ever'body got bruises. You 
wanna see the one on my ass? My wife 
gimme a love bite dat left a cute 
little heart shape.
Clyde offers to unbuckle his belt.
EDUARDO *
She gave me the same one. Must be her *
signature.
CLYDE
Why don't you come over here and say 
dat?
EDUARDO *
Clyde, doesn't it bother you that *
some swamp water meth head is getting 
over on us with this lame set-up? *
CLYDE
Only thang bothers me is know-it-all 
Ricans wit' too much time on they *
hands.
Eduardo lets the insult go by, but he doesn't like it. Then he *
smiles, coolly. *2."
"EDUARDO *
I'll just leave you boys to it. *
Clyde turns to Remi with a satisfied grin, got him good. 
Eduardo steps through the shack and out the door. Deputy *
Marcum follows him out to the dirt road where his car his 
parked.
DEPUTY MARCUM
You think somebody killed him?
EDUARDO *
And painted a big old sign that they *
did. But don't go banging heads with' *
them two rednecks. They already *
tainted up the crime scene.
Marcum nods as Eduardo gets in his Mustang and pulls out.*
CUT TO:
EXT. NEW ORLEANS - DUSK
Eduardo drives through the city. *
INTERNAL VOICE
Why do we kill? Everybody wants a 
simple answer. There are no simple 
answers. It takes a thousand agonies 
to erupt into one moment of murderous 
rage.
EXT. FAUBOURG MARIGNY - EVENING
An old time Creole burb. Eduardo pulls his Mustang in front of *
Archie's Joint, local grocery store, and goes in.
INT. ARCHIE'S JOINT - EVENING
At the counter, ARCHIE DAVIS, an exuberant Cajun in his mid-
fifties, holds court and shares cooking tips with AUNTIE TANE, 
a tiny, old backwoods woman. Eduardo eavesdrops on the pair.*
AUNTIE TANE
I stop usin' lard 'n start cooking 
dem sausage hounds in duck fat.
ARCHIE
Duck fat? You messin' wit' me, Auntie 
Tane.
She playfully elbows Eduardo. *3."
"AUNTIE TANE
Keep it quiet, sugar. Don't give 'way 
my secrets.
EDUARDO *
Your secret's safe with me. *
Archie wraps some sausage and hands her the package.
ARCHIE
Sweetheart, I'm gonna fry dat 
tonight. 
AUNTIE TANE
You be cookin' correct.
She pays for the meat and shuffles off.
ARCHIE
Duck fat.
(shakes his head)
What you need, Eduardo? *
EDUARDO *
Fuel.
ARCHIE
You want fuel, go to the gas station. 
I sell food. Lookah dis.
He produces a handful of fat, ripe red tomatoes.
ARCHIE (CONT'D)
From my garden. Fertilized with 
Mother Nature's own sweet cow shit.
Archie begins piling groceries on the counter as he speaks.
ARCHIE
Fry up some a dis sausage in duck 
fat, jus' like Auntie Tain, chop up 
some a these pretty tomatas, and pour 
it over a messa noodles.
He smacks a bottle of wine onto the counter top.
ARCHIE (CONT'D)
Pop open a lil' Argentine red 'n you 
have nourished your soul. Only thing 
missin' is a woman, and we are 
prohibited by law from providing dat 
service.
EDUARDO *
You know I'm not a wine drinker, 
Archie. 
(MORE)4."
"Always something bitter in the taste. 
Gimme a bottle of the usual.
ARCHIE
Yo' palate's jus' confused, man. It *
can't tell the diff'rence tween da 
bitter and da sweet. You gotta be da 
only man in New Orleans who don't 
'ppreciate da good flavors a life.
Eduardo knows it's useless to argue. He gathers up his package *
and, of course, Archie's slipped him a bottle of whiskey. They 
nod affectionate farewells and Eduardo heads off. *
ARCHIE (CONT'D)
We barbecuing out back come Saturday. 
Think you can make it, dis time?
EDUARDO *
I'll try.
They both know he's lying.
EXT./INT. EVERETT'S HOUSE- EVENING
A small cabin not far from Archie's Joint. An empty, 
impersonal space. Eduardo fries up his sausage in duck fat. He *
takes a swig of the Argentine red, swirls it in his mouth for 
a moment, then spits it down the sink. He pours himself a 
whiskey.
INT. KITCHEN - SHORTLY AFTER
Eduardo sits at the small kitchen table, chewing pasta and *
swilling the amber liquor. The house is silent. No music. 
EXT./INT. EVERETT'S CAR - NIGHT - MOVING
Pointless driving. Killing time. The faces on the street and 
in other cars seem more lost than ever.
INTERNAL VOICE
Sometimes it seems like we're all 
little bags of blood waiting to be 
popped-
FLASHCUT TO:
THE FACE OF A TERRIFIED MAN - MICHAEL WEBER
a gun is placed in his mouth and the trigger squeezes POP!
BACK TO:EDUARDO (cont'd)5."
"EVERETT'S FACE
startled by the image of--
INTERNAL VOICE
-and when we see some other bag 
popped, we're shocked-
EXT. A GRUESOME CAR ACCIDENT
on the highway before him. Paramedics pull a crumpled body out 
of the driver's seat.
INTERNAL VOICE
-for three or four seconds and then 
we just turn away.
EDUARDO  *
watches with morbid fascination for a moment, then he turns 
away and continues along the road.
INTERNAL VOICE
How easily we forget another life.
Eduardo rubs at some persistent pain between his temples.*
EXT. THROUGH NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT
Eduardo's Mustang pushes. Past the tourist sites and through *
the neighborhoods still struggling through the wounds of 
Katrina.
EXT. LAKESHORE DRIVE - NIGHT
Eduardo's Mustang fades into blackness along Lake *
Pontchartrain.
INT. EVERETT'S BEDROOM - WEE HOURS
Eduardo sleeps on his stomach, face scrunched into a pillow. *
An empty tumbler rests on the nightstand beside him. His 
CELLPHONE RINGS. Eduardo doesn't stir. The cellphone goes *
silent.
His HOUSEPHONE RINGS. Still, Eduardo doesn't move. The *
CELLPHONE joins in with the HOUSEPHONE.
Eduardo's eyes creak open. He looks at the clock. 2:14. He *
reaches for the cellphone.6."
"EDUARDO *
(grouchy)
Yeah.
CUT TO:
EXT. LAKESHORE DRIVE - NIGHT
Eduardo's mustang hugs the rim of Lake Pontchartrain. He turns *
down a small road, checking addresses. He finds a private 
drive and pulls in.
EXT. A BEAUTIFUL HOUSE ALONG THE LAKE
A stiff breeze steadily whooshes the leaves of the cypress and 
willow trees.
Eduardo parks and heads over to: *
Four patrol cars wait. Uniformed officers set up the perimeter 
of the crime scene.
A new Mercedes convertible sits in the drive. Several 
patrolmen wait on the periphery of the grounds.
Eduardo is met by OFFICER ROBERTO HERNANDEZ. *
HERNANDEZ *
(In Spanish) *
You gotta see this, Edu. *
 Eduardo takes in the grandeur of the house. *
EDUARDO *
(in Spanish) *
Big money.
HERNANDEZ *
(in Spanish) *
The house belongs to David and Eve *
Garon.
EDUARDO *
(in Spanish) *
Where they at?
HERNANDEZ *
(in Spanish) *
Home in the Garden District. This is 
their lake house. Check out this *
corpse. *
A CSI team arrives, headed by LAMONT DAVIS who comes over to 
join Eduardo. *7."
"LAMONT
Don't go fiddlin' wit dat body.
EDUARDO *
Never without you, Lamont. *
They pull on their latex gloves. And are greeted by CSI *
member, HURION. *
INT. THE HOUSE
A beautifully decorated home, every space a perfectly 
coordinated vignette with not one gauche touch. Eduardo takes *
in every detail.
Hurion leads them through the entry hall over to a doorway *
that leads downstairs. As they descend, Hurion hands them some *
face masks.
EDUARDO *
Is that smell what I think it is?
HURION *
Corpse is smeared with shit.
LAMONT
(pulling on his mask)
Well, that makes our jobs pleasant.
They touch down INTO:
INT. A LARGE WINE CELLAR
A pure white space with wine racks on the flanking walls. The 
three men stop and take in:
A NAKED MAN HANGS UPSIDE DOWN FROM THE BEAMS OF THE CEILING
His face and chest streaked with feces. A school tie knotted 
round his neck and a knife slit from groin to gullet.
There are four chairs neatly arranged beneath him. At the base 
of one of the chairs is a foot bath filled with jelling blood.
EDUARDO *
Oh, this is interesting. *
LAMONT
Could be the highlight of my week.
HURION *
You're looking at Michael Weber.8."
"LAMONT
Hello, Michael.
EDUARDO *
He looks like a Maori warrior. *
Eduardo scrutinizes the corpse. The back of the man's head is *
blown away.
Lamont examines the body. Looks down at the tub filled with 
blood.
LAMONT
Sumbody blood drained 'im.
EDUARDO *
Like a Halal butcher.
Lamont begins scanning the room. Eduardo pulls out a mini-*
smart camera.
MOMENTS LATER
Lamont's team are in the basement, tenting the corpse. Eduardo *
catches a young technician getting ready to spray the wall.
EDUARDO *
Lamont, tell this new jack you're the *
only one who sprays luminol in my 
crime scene.
Lamont snatches the spray away from the tech who struggles to 
hide his anger. Lamont evenly sprays down the walls.
EDUARDO CAREFULLY GOES THROUGH THE HOUSE *
Taking in every detail of the opulently appointed home. *
INT. THE MASTER BEDROOM - LATER
Eduardo lingers over some beautifully framed photos of the *
owners, EVE and DAVID GARON. On the dresser - some change, a 
Rolex watch, charge slips from restaurants, and something 
sitting in an ash tray catches his eye. A key chain. THE KEY 
FOB HAS SOME BYZANTINE LETTERING ON IT.
Eduardo places the key chain in an evidence bag. *
He goes to the unmade bed.
EDUARDO *
(calls out)
Lamont, I believe we have evidence of 
sexual activity over here.9."
"Lamont comes over. Eduardo points to a damp stain on the dark *
purple duvet cover. Lamont tape-tags it.
LAMONT
Come on, the tent must be ready.
They go back down.
INT. THE WINE CELLAR
A technician finishes constructing a PVC tent over the hanging 
body. Lamont and Eduardo pull on their masks and step inside.*
INSIDE THE PVC TENT
Lamont runs a laser over the corpse. EVERY MARK ON THE MAN'S 
BODY GLOWS IN THE BLACKNESS. Eduardo PIX-SNAPS EVERYTHING. As *
the red beam moves up to the torso area, Eduardo spots a *
discoloration along the ribs. He tape-tags it.
The red beam glides up the neck and when it reaches the 
face, a HIDEOUS GLOW SHOUTS FROM THE VICTIM'S MOUTH. 
Eduardo and Lamont lean in for a better view inside the *
oral cavity. 
LAMONT
His tongue's been cut out.
Eduardo aims his camera. *
MONTAGE - ALL THROUGHT THE NIGHT
Eduardo and Lamont's team work. Exploring every inch of the *
premises.
EDUARDO passes the bathroom and notices LAMONT trying to *
lift a fingerprint from under the toilet seat.
EDUARDO *
Lamont, no killer's left a print 
under the toilet seat since CSI *
debuted.
LAMONT
Eduardo, it's my lifelong fantasy *
to catch a murderer who don't 
watch no TV.
THE WORK CONTINUES. Eduardo and Lamont's team cover every *
square inch of every nook in and out of the premises.
Eduardo hovers behind Lamont as he runs his magic light over *
the last corner of the wine cellar. Finally, he clicks it off.10."
"LAMONT
Nothing. Not one trace of the shot, 
not a microscopic blood spatter. 
EDUARDO *
This fella wasn't killed here. *
EXT. GARON HOUSE - AS DAWN APPROACHES
The team finishes up. Eduardo hops into his car, racing the *
sunrise.
INT. POLICE STATION - DAWN
A funky place. A wall clock reads: “7:37 A.M.” PAN DOWN TO and 
exhausted EDUARDO finishing typing his MICHAEL WEBER *
INVESTIGATION REPORT. He places it in his desk’s top drawer.
INT. POLICE LOCKER ROOM - MORNING
EDUARDO snoozes on a cot, his jacket & weapon draped over *
his locker door. HIS CELLPHONE ALARM BUZZES: “9 A.M.” He 
hits the off button and drags to a urinal.
MOMENTS LATER
Eduardo rifles through his desk. Can't find his paperwork. He *
goes over to Desk Officer KLUDJIAN'S station.
EDUARDO *
Kludjian, where'd my case go?
Kludjian jerks a thumb at the boss's office. Eduardo barges *
into:
INT. WHITEHORN'S OFFICE
DALE WHITEHORN, good old boy, Captain of the homicide 
division, is at his desk.
EDUARDO *
Where's my murder?
WHITEHORN
Not yours anymore, Eduardo. Higher *
powers have stepped in. Your case has 
been subsumed by the Eighth District.
EDUARDO *
Subsumed?11."
"WHITEHORN
Dat's the word dey used. I had to 
look it up, myself. It means...
EDUARDO *
I know what it means. What I don't 
know is who subsumed my case to the 
CBD?
WHITEHORN
(shrugs)
Came from Chief of Police Kroll. 
Direct. Central Business District 
requested you join their 
investigation team.
EDUARDO *
Well, it's known to one and all I'm 
not a team player, boss.
WHITEHORN
Look, everybody knows you da smartest 
detective in Nawlins and what's it 
gotten you? Huh? 
EDUARDO *
I get to work with you, Dale. *
WHITEHORN
A little late in the day for you to 
suddenly become da star quarterback. 
For some reason they givin' you a 
chance to run wit' da varsity team. 
Just go in and say, ""ready to play 
ball, coach."" For da first time in 
yo' clumsy life, be a pol'tician.
EVERETT'S CAR - MORNING - MOVING
Eduardo's at the wheel, top down. Dark glasses screen out the *
intense sun. His Mustang moving down Canal street. He stops at 
a light.
On one side of him, a rotted old pickup truck, crammed full of 
strugglng Cajuns. On the other side, a cocoa skinned beauty at 
the wheel of a silver Porsche, blabbing on her i-phone. She *
doesn't toss Eduardo half a look. *
INTERNAL VOICE
It's a cold world that leaves most of 
us on the outside. Watching. Looking 
and wanting. Looking and wanting.
The light changes. Eduardo continues on. He notices-- *12."
"A homeless man, no more than thirty, sleeps against a fire 
hydrant. Behind him, the grand palaces of the Garden District.
INTERNAL VOICE (CONT'D)
You look and you want and you hate 
because you can't have. And you 
think, why can't I have? Who decided 
I can't have?
THE EIGHTH DISTRICT PRECINCT
The creme of New Orleans police departments. Eduardo is shown *
into the offices of CAPTAIN ROBERT CLOVIS, a tall, powerful 
commander in his late fifties.
CLOVIS
Eduardo Castro? Robert Clovis. *
They shake hands.
EDUARDO *
Good to meet you.
CLOVIS
Still have your accent. *
EDUARDO *
Excuse me?
CLOVIS
I did a bit of research on you. *
Interesting family. Raised by your *
grandmother in Puerto Rico. But she *
brought you up to Charlotte when you *
were twelve. I'm surprised them *
rednecks didn't beat that accent out *
of you. *
FLASHBACK TO*
A TWELVE YEAR OLD BOY *
Being bullied by a group of nasty white kids. *
BACK TO:*
EDUARDO AND CLOVIS *
Eduardo weighs how he's going to respond. *
EDUARDO *
Some things never go away. *13."
"CLOVIS
True dat. All the reports say you're *
a hell of a homicide man, though. *
Surprised nobody's heard of you 
before.
EDUARDO *
My grandmother handles all my PR. *
Clovis smiles at the wisecrack.
CLOVIS *
PR. I like that. *
Eduardo lets the second racist slur slide by. *
EDUARDO *
Why'd your department steal my murder 
investigation?
CLOVIS
Nothing was stolen. We brought you 
and the case in.
EDUARDO *
Yeah, I heard I was subsumed.
CLOVIS
The victim was politically important. 
Request came from the Mayor's Office 
to do everything to solve this crime. 
We're joining forces to expedite that 
action.
Clovis waves through his window and GILBERT FONTENOT, a 
paunchy detective in his mid thirties, enters.
CLOVIS
Eduardo, this is Gilbert Fontenot. *
He'll set you up in an office and 
show you round.
GILBERT LEADS EDUARDO THROUGH THE STATION *
Uncomfortably silent.
EDUARDO *
You one of the departmental hot shots 
or did Bob pair me off with a flunky?
GILBERT
(deadpan)
I'm a flunky.
EDUARDO *
Figured.14."
"They go into:
INT. EVERETT'S TEMPORARY OFFICE
A couple of unused desks and some storage cabinets.
GILBERT
You're quite the VIP with your own 
office.
Eduardo surveys the dank space. *
EDUARDO *
And my own personal sidekick.
They both smirk.
GILBERT
Captain Bob had me photocopy all your 
files.
EDUARDO *
Who kept my originals?
GILBERT
Captain Bob.
Eduardo goes through the evidence inventory. Rechecks *
something; turns to Gilbert.
EDUARDO *
Some of my evidence is missing. 
This is news to Gilbert.
EDUARDO *
There was a key chain with some *
ornamental writing on it. And a 
stained bedspread.
GILBERT
I'll look into it.
Eduardo begins thumb-tacking crime scene photos to the wall.*
EDUARDO *
You know anything about the man that *
got killed last night?
GILBERT
Michael Weber? Absolutely. One of the 
biggest developers in this city.
EDUARDO *
Lots of enemies? *15."
"GILBERT
All them big shots got big enemies.
Eduardo looks at a photo of the hanging corpse. *
EDUARDO *
Quite a tableaux.
GILBERT
Is that what I think it is spread all 
over his face? *
Eduardo nods. *
EDUARDO *
What do you think he was doing *
spreading all that shit on a dead 
man?
GILBERT
Humiliating him.
Eduardo regards Gilbert, pleasantly surprised. *
EDUARDO *
You're a smart little flunky. *
GILBERT
And I've been known to brush my teeth 
regularly.
They grin.
EDUARDO *
Come on, lets go talk to some rich 
people.
CUT TO:
EXT./INT.EVERETT'S CAR - DAY - MOVING
Eduardo's at the wheel, cruising silently with Gil beside *
him.
EXT. GARON HOUSE - DAY
A grand old mansion, set behind wrought iron gates. Eduardo *
stops the Mustang in the drive, just in time to see DETECTIVES 
HUNSMAN and KLEIN making for the front door. The two intercept 
Eduardo and Gil. *
HUNSMAN
What are you doing here?16."
"EDUARDO *
Questioning my suspects. Who the hell 
are you?
GILBERT
These are detectives Hunsman and 
Klein. They work with us.
HUNSMAN
(condescending)
We work, Gilbert. You make coffee.
Eduardo shoots Gilbert a you-gonna-take-that? look; sees *
Gilbert's embarrassment. Eduardo faces off with Hunsman.*
EDUARDO *
(to Hunsman)
Not today, asshole. I'll take mine 
black with two sugars.
KLEIN
Listen, Castro, we know all about *
you. And nobody wants you here. 
They're not your suspects. You're 
just along for the ride.
Gil steps between them.
GILBERT
Come on, Jay. We've been ordered to *
work together. You two can do the 
questioning, we'll just observe.
Eduardo starts to protest, but Gil raises a mollifying hand. *
Eduardo relents and follows the other detectives to the front *
door. Hunsman rings the bell. The door is answered by a Creole 
housekeeper, GISELLE.
CUT TO:
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
Southern grandeur with white trimmed french doors looking onto 
a sculpted garden. The detectives wait, the tension between 
them palpable.
They are suddenly aware of a presence entering the room. EVE 
GARON. She's a stunning woman, early forties, dark blondish 
hair, dressed in a linen summer dress that shows a bit of 
tanned leg. Eduardo can't take his eyes off her. *
EVE
I'm Eve Garon. How can I help you?17."
"KLEIN
Mrs. Garon, I'm Detective Klein, this 
is my partner, Detective Hunsman.
(as an afterthought)
Officers Fontenot and Castro. *
Polite hellos. Eve picks up on Eduardo staring at her. *
KLEIN (CONT'D)
Sorry to trouble you, Mrs. Garon. 
We're gathering background 
information on Michael Weber and we 
have to ask a few questions. We'll be 
out of here as quickly as possible.
EVE
That's all right. Please, sit down.
She takes a seat on the center couch. Klein and Hunsman sit 
opposite her. Gil discreetly sits off to the side and Eduardo *
remains standing against the far wall, watching stoically.
KLEIN
Mrs. Garon, how long have you known 
Michael Weber?
EVE
He's been my husband's partner for 
about six years.
Eduardo mutters something under his breath. Eve's unnerved *
by him.
KLEIN
Did you socialize frequently?
EVE
Yes. Obviously more when he and Ellen 
were still together.
Eve can feel Eduardo staring at her thighs. She tugs the hem *
of her dress down and shoots him a look. Eduardo whips his *
head around and his eyes search for a new resting place. He 
busies himself with the knickknacks on a French cherrywood 
table.
KLEIN
How long was Mr. Weber living at your 
lake house?
EVE
About five or six months.
KLEIN
Was the separation a bitter one?18."
"Eduardo's attention is caught by a polished stone bust of a *
beautiful woman. He studies it, fascinated. It could be Eve. 
His hand involuntarily reaches out to caress the cool cheek. 
Eve is distracted by Eduardo's attention to her possessions.*
EVE
I don't really know. We all had the 
feeling they'd get back together.
(turns to Eduardo) *
Excuse me, are you looking for 
something in particular, or just 
browsing?
Eduardo pulls back his hand. The other cops turn to Eduardo.*
EDUARDO *
Sorry, I--
EVE
Detective Klein, do you really need 
all this help just to ask a few 
questions? This man is making me very 
uncomfortable and I'd feel better if 
we could do this without the 
entourage.
Eduardo's mortified and doesn't know how to respond. *
KLEIN
(loving it)
No problem.
(turns to Gil)
Why don't you two meet us back at the 
station.
Eduardo's face is red with humiliation. He wants to respond, *
but he's tongue tied. He glowers at Eve who holds his eye 
contact.
GIL
Come on, Eduardo. *
EXT. GARON HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Gil and Eduardo cross the drive and head for the Mustang.*
EDUARDO *
Somebody please tell me I didn’t just 
see that princess tell the police how 
she wants to be questioned!
GIL
Easy, man. *19."
"EDUARDO *
Oh, I’m calm. I’m just a bit 
perplexed. This is all new to me. *
GIL
You're right, they were making things 
easy. Her husband's an important man.
EDUARDO *
She's a suspect.
GIL
Let's grab a couple po' boys and 
Cokes. We'll question her later.
Eduardo's placated. Gil let him escape with some dignity.*
EDUARDO *
No. We've got a body to look at.
CUT TO:
A FIELD OF WHITE
fills the screen. And slowly a large index finger enters and 
moves along the white, which is becoming blotchy with 
imperfections. Follow the finger as it stops to linger on the 
edge of a gaping greyish pink hole that falls into a black 
infinity.
CRUVERE (O.S.)
A single, .22 caliber bullet 
penetrated the soft palate at a 
perfect forty-five degree angle, and 
exited through the back of the skull.
PULL BACK TO:
INT. AUTOPSY ROOM - DAY
ANGELO CRUVERE, the M.E., guides Eduardo and Gil on a tour of *
the cadaver. He holds a penlight to the wound, for the two 
detectives to examine. Eduardo stares at the ashen corpse, *
with grey matted hair and an antiseptic cavity in the cranium.
CRUVERE
We found fragments of the bullet in 
what was left of his tongue and 
orbital bone.
The M.E. brings the flashlight to the knee area. 20."
"CRUVERE (CONT'D)
Look here. Small abrasions on both 
knees. The only signs of physical 
abuse before death.
EDUARDO *
What about cutting out the tongue?
CRUVERE
He did that a good twenty minutes 
after he died. That's why there's no 
real bleeding in the oral cavity.
Eduardo examines the torso, finds his greasemark. *
EDUARDO *
What's this here?
Cruvere looks closely.
CRUVERE
Cigarette burn.
EDUARDO *
Let's turn him over.
Eduardo and Gilbert help the doctor flip the corpse. The *
examination continues.
GILBERT
He's got another burn here on his 
butt cheek.
Gilbert points to a red welt on the side of his buttocks.
CRUVERE *
Yeah. He got that while he was *
still alive. *
*
Eduardo peers into the gaping hole in the back of the skull; *
checks all the angles. Cruvere notices and leans in to him.*
CRUVERE *
You know, the angle of this gun wound 
is very similar to suicide.
FLASHCUT TO:
A MAN ON HIS KNEES *
A Central American soldier puts a gun in his mouth and *
blows his head off. *
BACK TO:21."
"EDUARDO  *
Doesn't move. *
EDUARDO *
Maybe. *
CUT TO:
INT. DAVID GARON'S OFFICE - DAY
Grand. Exquisitely decorated. An office for a giant. Eduardo *
and Gil are shown in by Garon's attractive, young assistant 
CAROL CHEE. DAVID GARON, forties, trim, tanned, and completely 
at ease with himself, crosses to meet them.
DAVID
I'm sorry to keep you waiting. I'm 
David Garon.
He offers a warm, manicured hand to Eduardo who can't help but *
compare his own chewed up cuticles.
EDUARDO *
Detective Castro. This is Detective *
Fontenot.
Garon shakes Gil's hand.
DAVID
Please, sit down.
He steers them into a circle of lush couches.
DAVID (CONT'D)
Carol, coffees please.
She vanishes before either of the cops can refuse.
DAVID (CONT'D)
Now, what can I do for you?
EDUARDO *
We're filling in some of the details *
of your partner's life. We understand 
he was separated from his wife for 
the past six months and living at 
your lake house.
DAVID
Correct.
EDUARDO *
Tell us anything about his lifestyle, 
to the best of your recollection.22."
"Carol returns.
CAROL
Excuse me, Mr. Garon. Mr. Lundt on 
line one.
GARON
(to the detectives)
A must call. I'm sorry.
The detectives nod, okay, as Garon goes to his desk and 
picks up the phone.
DAVID (CONT'D)
Klaus?
(in German)
How are you?... I'm fine. Yes, 
it's terrible... Thank you. No, 
don't worry... We’re ready... Yes, 
let me pull up the numbers...
Garon shows off his German and waves to Carol who quickly 
retrieves the figures from the laptop. Then she pops out.
Eduardo and Gil take in his world -- beautiful things adorn *
his office. Every piece worth more than a cop could ever 
earn in a lifetime.
Carol returns carrying a silver coffee service and sets it 
on the table before the detectives. She allows a pinch of 
eye contact to linger on Eduardo before she saunters off. *
Gilbert smiles and fills his coffee with sugar. Then he 
PLAYFULLY TUCKS THE SILVER SUGAR TONGS INSIDE HIS POCKET. *
Eduardo frowns and Gilbert puts them back. Garon returns.*
GARON
Apologies, Gentlemen.
He sits regally before them. Eduardo gets right to it. *
EDUARDO *
Was Weber dating?
DAVID
He'd started dating again. But 
nothing serious that I know of. 
EDUARDO *
Social life?
GARON
He played golf at the club, did a 
little boating in the Gulf when he 
had the time. Mostly, he was absorbed 
in our business.23."
"EDUARDO *
Would you happen to know of any 
recent sexual partners?
David raises an eyebrow.
DAVID
Michael never mentioned anybody 
special.
EDUARDO *
Anybody not so special?
DAVID
He never talked about that sort of 
thing with me. I'm sure he went out. 
But I know he took the break up with 
his wife pretty hard.
EDUARDO *
Were there any recent business 
conflicts that might have made him 
some enemies?
DAVID
You're kidding, right? We're one of 
the biggest real estate developers in 
this region. If you don't have a 
thousand people mad at you at any 
given moment, you're probably in the 
wrong game.
Eduardo and Gilbert exchange a look. *
INT. HALLWAY - LATER
Carol escorts Eduardo and Gil to the elevator. As she pushes *
the button for them, she shoots Eduardo that ""special eye."" He *
buys in.
EDUARDO *
Been working here a long time, Carol? *
CAROL
Five years, straight out of Xavier 
U.
EDUARDO *
What was your take on Weber?
CAROL
He was a very dynamic businessman. A 
stickler for detail. He worked...24."
"EDUARDO *
No, no, Carol, What was the man like? 
Did he bring in donuts every morning? 
Did people like him? Did he photocopy 
his ass at the Christmas Party?
CAROL
No, to all of the above. He was,
Umm, how should I say this? A 
complete prick.
Eduardo glints a telling look with Gil; turns back to Carol *
who smiles coolly.
CAROL (CONT'D)
Your card?
(off his look)
In case we need to be in touch.
He presses his card into her hand. An invitation in the 
air. Gil covers a furtive smile as she clicks back to her 
office. *
INT. BAR - LATE AFTERNOON
Eduardo and Gil sit at a back table drinking scotch and *
munching bar snacks.
EDUARDO *
This killing was very personal.
GILBERT
How's that?
EDUARDO *
He kept him on his knees. I think he 
must've been talking to him.
GILBERT
Why you think he was talking to him?
EDUARDO *
Well, if you forced a man to stay on 
his knees before you killed him, 
wouldn't you make a little *
conversation?
Gilbert grins and shakes his head.
GILBERT
Not me. I like my victims to keep 
quiet. It helps my concentration.
EDUARDO *
Noted. *25."
"Eduardo waves for more scotch. *
EDUARDO *
I like the four chairs. Very rich *
with symbolism. *
GILBERT
Yeah, that's very mystical. But I 
like that there's no trace of where 
he killed this boy. That's clever.
EDUARDO *
Oh, he's definitely clever. He could 
bounce us back and forth like a ping 
pong ball.
GILBERT
For days. *
EDUARDO *
All that big display spells out *
crazy, but you cut out a man's tongue 
and you're saying you don't like the *
way he does business.
GILBERT
So, you think it could be a motivated *
killing dressed up like a random 
psycho? *
EDUARDO *
We have to play the possibility.
(leans back)
This case is gonna make us stars.
GILBERT
You don't seem like the type who 
cares about that sort of thing.
EDUARDO *
That sort of thing is what this world 
is about, Gil. It don't matter how 
good you are. It's how good they say 
you are. You know what Clovis told me 
about you? *
Gil gives an insecure little shrug.
EDUARDO (CONT'D) *
Not a damned thing. How's that make *
you feel?
GIL
Shitty.
EDUARDO *
Yeah, well, your day is coming.26."
"He gives his shot glass an emphatic clink.
EDUARDO *
What we've got to figure out is how 
he chose this victim. We have to get 
inside his head. Understand what I'm 
feeling.
Gil shoots Eduardo a surprised look. *
EDUARDO (CONT'D) *
What?
GIL
You said, understand what I'm 
feeling.
Eduardo shrugs it off, throws some bills down and they split.*
INTERNAL VOICE
How can you understand what someone 
else is feeling?
EXT./INT. EVERETT'S MUSTANG - LATE AFTERNOON
Eduardo drives down the ramp to the coast highway, lost in a *
sea of distant masks.
INTERNAL VOICE
Can you pull someone else inside your 
head? Can they pull you inside 
theirs? If we could break down that 
wall... if we could truly 
understand... How could we hurt each 
other?
INT. LAKESIDE POLICE STATION
Eduardo goes to the evidence clerk, ODILIA, a blowsy bayou *
hellcat in her late-forties. Sharp as broken glass. Eduardo *
slides her a Snickers bar.
ODILIA
It ain't my birthday. What you 
want you ol' rascal?
EDUARDO *
Odilia, may I see the evidence log 
from the lake murder?
ODILIA
Nope. I had to turn it over to the 
Eighth.27."
"EDUARDO *
Your computer files?
ODILIA
Some swinging dick come in here and 
swiped all my files. What you need?
EDUARDO *
Do you remember what they took?
ODILIA
Every last bit. I watched over their 
shoulders.
EDUARDO *
They take a bedspread?
ODILIA
Yep. They jes forgot one lil' thing.
Eduardo waits. *
ODILIA
Lamont cut a swatch outta dat 
bedspread and had already sent it to 
the lab. I was jes' about to log it 
in when them dickheads hijacked my 
shit.
Eduardo breaks into a wide grin. *
ODILIA
Bet I don't look like such a dumbass 
redneck hoochie now, huh?
EDUARDO *
Darling, you're just about as perfect *
as Angelina Jolie with a PHD. *
ODILIA
Jes remember I'm a married woman, 
Detective.
EDUARDO *
I will respect that. Could I ask you *
to intercept those lab findings *
before any of our friends in the 
Eighth District get their hands on *
them?
ODILIA
Count on it. Don't like them stuck up 
assholes, no how.
CUT TO:28."
"EXT. LAKE HOUSE - DUSK
The Garon lake house sits against a dimming sky of smoky pink 
and purple. A lone police car is parked out front. The 
property is quiet and rimmed with yellow police tape. Eduardo *
parks out front, ducks under the tape, and walks to the house 
where patrolman ROBERTO HERNANDEZ keeps watch. Efran greets *
him in Spanish. *
EDUARDO *
Como estas, Roberto? *
HERNANDEZ
(Spanish) *
Bored shitless, Eduardo. *
EDUARDO *
(Spanish) *
I'm gonna be here for at least an 
hour. Go grab some coffee.
Hernandez nods thanks, undoes the door seals for Eduardo.*
INT. LAKE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
The lights are off, dim in the dusky shadows. Eduardo slowly *
feels his way through the house. Not looking for anything in 
particular. Just letting the death scene do the talking.
There's no sign of any murder, just THE PRESENCE OF EVE 
GARON'S FINE TOUCHES. Eduardo moves to-- *
INT. THE MASTER BEDROOM
Just as the team left it. Eduardo steps lightly through the *
room, lingering over each new perspective.
INT. THE WINE CELLAR
Eduardo enters the eerie, windowless room, takes in the now *
corpseless space. 
FLASHCUT TO:
MICHAEL WEBER’S TERRIFIED FACE
As the gun is placed in his mouth and the trigger squeezes:
EDUARDO IS SNAPPED OUT OF HIS REVERY WHEN *
SUDDENLY A FLOORBOARD CREAKS. He freezes.29."
"He feels something just outside the door. He eases his pistol 
out of its holster then EXPLODES INTO THE HALLWAY, PINNING THE 
INTRUDER WITH A FOREARM across the throat and a muzzle between 
the eyes. It's--
EVE GARON, her eyes wide with shock. Eduardo's adrenaline *
pumps furiously. He grabs her arm.
EDUARDO *
What the hell are you doing here?!
EVE
(stutters)
This is my house.
She's wobbled by the assault and tries to pull free. His rage 
is massive and she's scared of him.
EDUARDO *
This is not your house! This is a 
murder scene! That yellow tape makes 
it my house. Now what are you doing 
in my house!?
EVE
I don’t... I wanted to see...
EDUARDO *
Oh, you wanted a personal tour? Come 
on, princess, you're gonna get your *
reward!
He grabs her by the arm, dragging her down the hallway.
EVE
What are you... Stop!
She tries to resist, but he's moving.
EXT. LAKE HOUSE - DUSK
Eduardo drags Eve out of the front door and slams it behind *
him. She tries to wriggle free. Not a chance.
EVE
What are you doing? Let go of me!
He drags her over to his car, pushes her into the passenger 
seat.
EVE
What the hell are you doing?
EDUARDO *
Listen tight, princess. You crossed 
the tape at a murder scene. 
(MORE)30."
"That is a felony. You going to jail. *
(produces handcuffs)
Cuffs, or no cuffs?
She stares icily into his eyes and then defiantly holds out 
her hands to be cuffed. He complies, closes the door, then 
gets into the driver's seat.
Eduardo whips the Mustang around and roars down the street, *
just as Hernandez is pulling up with his styrofoam coffee fix. 
Hernandez watches Eduardo zoom off with Eve Garon. *
IN THE MUSTANG - EVENING - MOVING
Eduardo and Eve motor silently down Lakeshore Drive. *
CUT TO:
INT. CLOVIS'S OFFICE - EVENING
Clovis meets with Gilbert.
CLOVIS
Gilbert, if you look at a map of 
human survival, you will see it is 
entirely dependent on clubs. You *
wanna be a doctor, you gotta get in 
the club. You wanna be a lawyer, 
that's another club. An athlete, a 
garbage man, a fireman. Or a cop. 
You've got to belong to a club.
GILBERT
I'm already in the police club.
CLOVIS
You are in the police union, Gilbert. 
But you're not an insider.
He lets the point sink in.
CLOVIS
It's all a club within a club, 
Gilbert. Everything. If you want to 
be inside you've got to display 
obedience. You have to show that you 
are willing to eat all kinds of shit 
from your betters in order to be part 
of the club. Then, maybe, they'll *
accept you. Or maybe they won't. 
(pause)
Are you prepared to eat shit, 
Gilbert?EDUARDO (cont'd)31."
"GILBERT
I've already eaten plenty.
Clovis leans over him.
CLOVIS
I wanna know everything that Eduardo *
Castro is up to. *
CUT TO:
EXT./INT. THE MUSTANG - EVENING - MOVING
The travelers are silent. Eve's confused when Eduardo swings *
East.
EVE
This isn't the way to the CBD.
EDUARDO *
You think we're going to the Eighth, 
for a latte and a little gossip? 
You're gonna see how the other half 
lives.
INT. THIRD DISTRICT STATION - EVENING
A gritty, underfunded police department in a bad part of town.
Eduardo enters with his cuffed princess. FRANK, the watch *
commander, sits behind the glass.
EDUARDO *
Frankie.
FRANK
Ed. *
(sizes up Eve)
She blow away her pimp?
EDUARDO *
Maybe.
Frank buzzes them through to the plate glass windowed holding 
room. Eduardo plunks Eve down on the bench beside some funky, *
ghetto hoochies.
EDUARDO (CONT'D) *
Don't go away.
EVE
I want to call my lawyer.
He ignores her and exits. The bad asses size her up. She's 
tough. She watches through the glass.32."
"Eduardo grabs a cup of coffee and jokes with the uniforms. He *
tells his story and a few cops peek over to check her out.
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT
A dank, windowless room with two chairs. Eduardo sits Eve down *
in one, then swings the other chair around and sits across 
from her, resting his forearms on the chair back.
EDUARDO *
Now tell me why you crossed that 
police line.
EVE
I want my lawyer.
Eduardo stares right into her eyes. His face is stone cold.*
EDUARDO *
You're on seventy-two hour hold *
before I have to let you make one 
phone call. Now there's not a chance 
of you seeing nobody until you tell *
me what you were doing crossint a *
police line.
EVE
You keep me here for three days and 
you are throwing your life away.
She holds his eye contact.
EDUARDO *
Listen tight, princess, some of us 
don't really care all that much who 
your husband is. So start talking.
EVE
Can I go to the bathroom, please?
EDUARDO *
You can piss in your panties, 
darlin'.
She looks up at him, searching into his anger.
EVE
This isn't about me crossing a police 
line, this is about me embarrassing 
you at my house.
EDUARDO *
This is about you embarrassing every 
person who has to kiss your golden 
behind.33."
"She stares into his eyes, long and hard. He holds contact. *
Finally, a blaze of satisfaction flashes in her eyes. *
EVE *
No. This isn't about any of that. *
This runs deeper. This is about *
you trying to get back at every *
white person who's ever *
embarrassed you for being Latino. *
She holds his eye contact. His anger wells, but he says *
nothing. Who the fuck is this woman? *
They stalemate for a mini eternity, then:
EVE
I need to go to the bathroom.
EDUARDO *
I said piss yourself. *
Eduardo shrugs. Eve stares angrily into his eyes. Then her *
face changes, and accepting her position, her lips part 
slightly and she releases. The sound of WATER TRICKLING gently 
down to the floor causes Eduardo's eyes to widen. He looks *
down to see--
a steady stream of piss spreads through her skirt and floods 
the chair, dripping down her legs to the floor below.
Eduardo stares at her in stunned disbelief. Eve never takes *
her eyes from his. Her face is placid. Then, the trickling 
stops.
EVE (CONT'D)
Now that you've humiliated me, can I 
please go home?
Eduardo's too mortified to speak. She's won again. *
EXT. THE STATION - NIGHT
Eduardo silently holds open the passenger door for Eve, closes *
it behind her, then timidly steps into his Mustang. The ENGINE 
FIRES UP and meekly pulls into the street.
EXT. LAKE HOUSE - NIGHT
Eduardo's Mustang comes to a halt across from the house. Eve *
steps out of the car, shutting the door behind her with a 
gentle thud, never looking back. Eduardo watches her get into *
her car and drive off. He sits for a moment, then looks down 
at the URINE SOAKED SEAT. Self-disgust envelops him.34."
"INT. ARCHIE'S JOINT - NIGHT
The place is closed. The only light comes from the glass meat 
cases. Eduardo leans at the counter eating a pork sandwich. *
Archie stands behind the counter, his face incredulous.
ARCHIE
She pissed?
Eduardo nods and takes a swig of beer. *
EDUARDO *
Looked me dead in the eye the whole 
time.
ARCHIE
(shaking his head)
Danng! Dat is not a typical princess.
Eduardo tilts his head, no shit. They stand in silence at the *
counter, swigging beer; Archie occasionally shaking his head 
as he thinks of Eve. Then he looks up at Eduardo. *
ARCHIE (CONT'D)
Eddie, we've known each other 'bout *
what, eight years now? How come you 
never accept an invitation to my 
house? 
EDUARDO *
Is it that long?
ARCHIE
Answer my question.
Eduardo takes a moment, then: *
EDUARDO *
Because I like you, Archie. And if it *
turned out you live like shit, I 
wouldn't want to see it.
ARCHIE
Brother, I'm happy with my life. You *
think anybody's disapproval would 
ruin that?
Eduardo shrugs a goofy ""I know I'm fucked up."" *
ARCHIE
When you walk into my house, you'll *
see some cracks in da ceiling and 
some moth holes in da upholstery. But 
would you notice da color of da 
geraniums in my window box?35."
"Eduardo can't answer. *

INT. STATION - EVIDENCE CLERK'S DESK - DAY
Eduardo gets the low down from Odilia. *
ODILIA
Got a DNA match from the lab. Your 
semen sample came from Dewayne 
Shayes.
EDUARDO *
Michael Weber had a man with him that 
night?
ODILIA
Shayes got a record for sissy 
prostitution and a couple B&E's. He 
turns tricks for this pimp named 
Ruchon. Runs a bar out in Chalmette.
EDUARDO *
Odilia, I love you and I owe you.
ODILIA
We only accept cash.
Eduardo winks and takes off. *

car round.
INT. AMADEE'S - A BAR IN THE QUARTER
One of the better drinking establishments. Eduardo walks up to *
find Carol Chee working a martini.
EDUARDO *
No need to wait.
CAROL
I didn't.

Lets have one more round and get this 
murder talk out of the way so we can 
have some fun.36."
"EDUARDO *
I like your plan.
(waves to the bartender)
Another for the lady and a Dewars 
neat.
The bartender nods.
CAROL
What more would you like to know 
about Michael?
EDUARDO *
I don't know anything other than he 
was a complete prick, in your very 
own words.
CAROL
That's the whole picture.
EDUARDO *
What was he like in business?
CAROL
Michael was the same in everything. 
He had to win. All the time. His 
wife, his kids, his employees, his 
business.
EDUARDO *
Boyfriends?
CAROL
(suprised)
Huh? No, Michael wasn't gay.
EDUARDO *
Not even a little?
CAROL

It could've been part of his kink. 
But not because he liked boys.

He just liked to dominate.

"His bathroom door swings open and a COMPLETELY NUDE CAROL 
EMERGES. She sensuously paints her lips before dressing.
EDUARDO (CONT'D) *

Eduardo's car stops in front of a low, clapboard building with *
no windows. No signage. Eduardo enters the front door. *
INT. THE BAR
A dark den of depravity. You can smell the malevolence. The 
place looks empty except for RUCHON, the wraith behind the 
bar. Eduardo shows his shield. Ruchon's not impressed. *
RUCHON
You don't wanna be bothrin' nobody 
here. Dis place is protected by 
bigger badges den yo's.
EDUARDO *
Oh, because you supply party boys to 
some big shots you think you don't 
have to talk to me?
RUCHON
Because peoples who sign your checks

RUCHON
Well, you hear all kinda bullshit if

assholes.
Eduardo reaches over for Ruchon, but -- *
EVERETT'S HEAD IS GRABBED FROM BEHIND AND SLAMMED AGAINST THE 
BAR!
HUGE HANDS PRESS EVERETT'S FACE INTO THE BAR AND SQUEEZE HIS 
THROAT! SOME KIND OF SHAVEN HEADED BEHEMOTH BEGINS CHOKING THE 
LIFE OUT OF EDUARDO! *
Ruchon leans his face into Eduardo's and begins making the *
jerk off gesture.
RUCHON
You best have one last jerk right 
now, detective. Mights be yo' last 
opportunity.
Eduardo's head is bounced against the bar and he is lifted off *
of his feet.
EDUARDO *
Get him off me!
Eduardo reaches for his gun. The Behemoth grabs the gun out of *
his hands and shoves it in his pocket while he holds Eduardo's *
throat with one hand.
RUCHON
How I'm gonna do dat, officer?
EDUARDO *
You really want every cop in New 
Orleans down here? You think I didn't 
log in?
Ruchon nods over to the Behemoth who tosses Eduardo across the *
room. He hits the wall and crumples down.
Eduardo picks himself up and staggers out of the door, blood *
pouring from his face. Much to the amusement of the two men.39."
"EXT. BAR - CONTINUOUS
Eduardo unlocks his car; slumps inside. Gets a water bottle *
out of his glove compartment, splashes his face and takes a *
sip. He grabs his radio and hoarsely whispers. *

Eduardo straddles Ruchon -- presses the shotgun into his *
mouth.

Talk.
RUCHON
Dat boy live over in Bayou Lafayette. 
He got a little party shack he tricks 
outta behind Tombs Landin'!

INT. THE BAR
Cops are everywhere. A paramedic wraps Ruchon's hand. *
Clovis sits with Eduardo. *40."
"EDUARDO *
I was questioning the bartender when 
King Kong Baldy attacked me from 
behind. He disarmed me and threw me 
against the wall. I went to my car, 
got a shotgun, and came back in to 
retrieve my weapon and make the 
arrest. Baldy pulled my gun on me and 
I shot him.
RUCHON
He's lying! He came in shooting! 
Ain't asked nothin'!
EDUARDO *
That one over there went for the gun 
and I shot his hand.
RUCHON
Liar! He jes shot off my fingers fo' 
no reason! You set this right, 
Clovis!
Clovis goes over to the injured man. His eyes burn into him.
CLOVIS
You watch how you address a police 
captain or I'll tear off the rest of 
your damn fingers.
Ruchon cowers under Clovis's menace. Eduardo can see the *
bartender's legitimate fear. Clovis nods to a pair of officers 
to get Ruchon outta here. They do so. Clovis goes back to 
Eduardo. *
CLOVIS
Why didn't you wait for back up?
EDUARDO *
Cause Baldy gave me a beating and *
took my gun. Nobody takes my gun.
CLOVIS
And lives, huh? Shit, I'd have done 
the same thing. I got no problem with 
your story. What were you doing down 
here?
EDUARDO *
Running a lead on a local rent boy 
who was at the lake house the night 
Weber got killed.
CLOVIS
I didn't see nothing in the crime 
report.41."
"EDUARDO *
Your boys pushed around some people 
at my station and they forgot to turn *
over a lab finding. *
CLOVIS
(laughs)
Had to have been Hunsman and Klein. 
My two best politicians.
Gilbert arrives, stops when he sees Eduardo's bloody face.*
GILBERT
What the hell happened?
CLOVIS
What happened is you're taking this 
man for a CAT scan. If he tries to 
duck out of it, use force. If he 
succeeds you are expeditiously off

Eduardo removes the ice pack. Gil gets a gander at his gashed *
face.
GILBERT
Damn, there goes your handsome looks.

Wasn't doing me much good anyway.
GILBERT
What were you doin' down in that neck

An old Toyota pick-up pulls up to a little shack in the woods. 
DEWAYNE SHAYES, lean, crude, attractive, heads inside.
As he opens the door, latex gloved hands clamp round his neck

the hands are way too strong. HE BLACKS OUT.
ISOLATED CAMP GROUNDS IN THE BAYOU - DUSK
The private camp site of the Inner Circle. Spartan wooden

ROBERT CLOVIS hovering above him wearing latex gloves, smoking 
a cigarette.
CLOVIS
Lots of rough trade.
DEWAYNE
What do you want?
CLOVIS
I wanna know what happens at these 
parties. I've never been invited to 
one.
DEWAYNE
They do the same sick shit you're 
about to do.
CLOVIS
I hear they like to burn asses with 
cigarettes. Kinda their signature.43."
"Clovis yanks Dewayne's pants down exposing some fresh burns on 
his buttocks.
CLOVIS
Now ain't that some terrible frat boy 
behavior.
He stubs out the cigarette on Dewayne's ass, eliciting a yelp.

Ooh, that is kinda fun.

Get the fuck off me, you twisted

Clovis laughs.
CLOVIS
Oh, yeah, I can see you've got 
friends in high places. You were with 
one of them a couple a nights ago. *
DEWAYNE
So?
CLOVIS
So. He got killed that same night. 
And I think you saw something.
DEWAYNE
I left before it happened.
CLOVIS
Tell me about your relationship with 
Michael Weber.
DEWAYNE
That was his name?
Clovis whips a stick across the side of his face.
CLOVIS
I look like one of those country club 
bitches who likes to dress up? Huh, 
boy?!
DEWAYNE
No!
CLOVIS
I want every detail of every moment 
you had with Michael Weber and if you 
leave out anything I'll cut your nuts 
off and hang them on my dashboard.44."
"DEWAYNE
I met him here at one of their camp 
parties. He said he'd pay me good to *
have some fun.
CLOVIS
What kind of fun?
DEWAYNE
I sucked his dick while he talked 
about all the pussy he gets. He paid 
me and I went home.
CLOVIS
You didn't see nothing before you 
left? Nobody lurking around? Nothing 
suspicious. No faces?
DEWAYNE
I didn't see shit. Nothing.
Clovis begins doing something we can't see. Dewayne waits 
fearfully.
CLOVIS
I have to admit that I initially 
didn't appreciate the exotic tastes 
of these country club sissies.
He jams a sock in Dewayne's mouth.
CLOVIS
But it's growing on me.
Clovis rams his prick up Dewayne's ass. Dewayne grunts and 
groans as it gets rougher. Clovis grins and rides like a rodeo *
cowboy. *
CUT TO:
INT. EVERETT'S HOUSE - NIGHT
The GULF WIND RUSTLES THE TREES. Eduardo can't sleep. He *
goes out on to his porch; looks across at the silent misery 
of his neighborhood. A gate creaks in the wind.
INTERNAL VOICE
If there were a just God, why would 
he allow the laughter of evil men to 
echo through the land?
Eduardo lights a cigarette. *
DISSOLVE TO:45."
"EXT. THE NINTH WARD - MORNING
The hardest hit Post-Katrina neighborhood. A patchwork of 
forgotten clapboard carcasses that were once peoples' homes 
interspersed with pockets of recent development.
Eduardo pulls up to a derelict lot where Gilbert is helping a *
group of NUNS get signatures. Eduardo yells out the window.*
EDUARDO *
You moonlighting as a preacher?
GILBERT
Worse. A community activist.
EDUARDO *
Well, drop that clipboard and get in 
the car. It's nearly post-time.
Gilbert hands his clipboard to SISTER JEAN.
GILBERT
Sister Jean, my other obligation 
calls. But I'll see you at tomorrow's 
service.
SISTER JEAN
Don't run over any citizens trying to 
make it to the betting window.
They share a laugh. Gilbert hops in the mustang.
EXT. THE FAIRGROUNDS RACETRACK - DAY
Eduardo and Gilbert bop through the crowd; pick up racing *
forms.  Over the PA, an announcer calls the first race.
EDUARDO *
The one thing that can make me forget 
corpses at the office. *
GILBERT
A pack of fillies coming around the 
clubhouse turn and a cool drink.
EDUARDO *
Say that!
They hit the bar. Gilbert waves for two; turns to Eduardo.*
GILBERT *
So what do you like being called, *
Eduardo, Eddie, Ed? *46."
"EDUARDO *
I don't really mind. Not crazy *
about wetback, though. *
Gilbert nods, considers. *
GILBERT *
Is that because you don't like *
being confused with Mexican? *
Eduardo takes him in - WTF? - realizes he's joking; laughs.*
EDUARDO *
You're a dark man, Gilberto. I *
like that. You can call me Edu. *
The bartender slaps two longnecks on the counter. Eduardo *
pays. *
GILBERT *
Thanks, Edu. *
They clink glasses. Sip their beers and dive into their *
betting sheets.
EDUARDO *
Oh, how can I not bet on a pony named 
Pineapple Jack?
GILBERT
That's your foolproof system?
EDUARDO *
It's an offshoot of my extraordinary *
police instinct.
Gilbert clinks bottles with him.
MONTAGE - ASSORTED IMAGES - THROUGH OUT THE DAY
Eduardo and Gilbert. Arguing and laughing over the horses.*
Another race finishes. Once again, losers. Eduardo tears up *
his ticket and downs his beer. Something catches his eye. 
Eduardo spots a woman in a big hat and dark glasses. It's Eve *
Garon.
EDUARDO *
Well, look at that. *
GILBERT
Is that who I think it is?
EDUARDO *
There are no coincidences, Gilbert.47."
"Eduardo goes over. Gilbert watches him approach the private *
box. Eduardo taps on Eve's chair, points to the empty seat *
beside her.
EDUARDO *
Is this seat taken?
EVE
I doubt that would stop you.
EDUARDO *
This is that rare moment I'm known to 
behave like a true gentleman.
EVE
Rare indeed.
He sits beside her.
EDUARDO *
I bet on the first and second races *
and haven't made a good pick yet. *
EVE
You're just not lucky. *
EDUARDO *
I'm about to disprove that. *
The horses take off again. Eduardo leans forward, following *
his horse. It looks good. He glances down at Eve and notices 
that she is not watching the race. *
He follows her sight line.  A few boxes over and down, he 
sees:
DAVID GARON
His arm draped across the honey shoulders of a gorgeous young 
blonde in a spaghetti strap dress.
EDUARDO  *
turns to Eve.  She never takes her eyes off the pair. Eduardo *
doesn't know how to respond, watches in silence.
EVE
She's stunning. How old do you think 
she is?
EDUARDO *
I’m gonna be kind and say, forty-
four.48."
"She regards the uncharacteristically sweet detective for a 
moment. Then she returns her attention to the couple.
EDUARDO (CONT'D) *
Why are you watching this?
EVE
I don't know. I don't love him 
anymore. I wanted to see if he 
touches her the way he used to touch 
me.
EDUARDO *
Does he?
Garon caresses the girl's cheek with the back of his hand.
EVE
(painfully)
Yes.
EDUARDO *
Come on. There's a nicer view in the 
club house.
EVE
I like the view right here. *
EDUARDO *
(gently)
I insist.
He respectfully takes her elbow and leads her away. *
INT. BAR - SUNSET
One of those dark watering holes, where all the customers can 
use their best pick up lines without being laughed at. Eve and 
Eduardo sit alone in the corner, drinks in front of them. *
Eve's face is gorgeous, the glasses and hat are off. She's 
lost, in a lot of pain, but dignified as hell.
EDUARDO *
I'm sorry. For the way I treated you 
the other night.
EVE
It's been one of those weeks.
Eduardo fumbles for comforting words. *
EDUARDO *
Sometimes people just grow apart.
EVE
And sometimes people just get used.49."
"Eduardo draws a breath, unfolds his hands. *
EDUARDO *
He's a rich businessman. They use 
people.
EVE
I played my part. I schemed with him 
and celebrated when we outmaneuvered 
the competition. I can't pretend I'm 
above it.
EDUARDO *
Don't beat on yourself. 
EVE
Why not?
EDUARDO *
Not a lot of women could have watched 
that without freaking out. You were *
pretty tough.
EVE
Tough? Sneaking out here to spy on my 
husband with his young beauty? 
Feeling like nothing because a man I 
despise rejected me?
(sneers)
I can't imagine anything more 
repulsively weak.
EDUARDO *
(gently)
What should you have done?
EVE
I should have been alive. I should 
have ripped her hair out and made a 
nice ugly scene for hubby.
EDUARDO *
(playfully)
We can go back.
She smiles for the first time; takes in his face.
EVE
That's quite a collection of bruises 
on your face.
EDUARDO *
I only work with the best.
They hold eye contact.50."
"EVE
Tell me about yourself.
EDUARDO *
Not much to tell. I'm the smartest, 
hardest working man in New Orleans *
Homicide. I don't make any money, my 
mortgage is always late, and I don't 
get any promotions. 
EVE
Why not?
EDUARDO *
Grandmother says its my grating *
personality.
EVE
Grandmothers knows best. *
EDUARDO *
That's usually the case.
She sips her drink.
EVE
Are you going to be the one to catch 
Michael's killer?
EDUARDO *
Absolutely. This boy is mine. We're *
practically family.
EVE
Oh, are you a killer, too?
EDUARDO *
I understand it. Everybody has the 
potential. All these dangerous things 
swimming round inside waiting for *
that one crazy moment when there 
ain't no rules. 
The booze and the intensity's got them sailing into a *
dreamland of acute possibilities.
EVE
Like tonight?
He holds her eyes with his.
EDUARDO *
Oh, yeah. Tonight, anything goes. 
Neglected wife spying on her cheating *
hubby with a young hottie. *
(MORE)51."
"She could commit murder, or change 
her hairstyle. Get religion. Take it 
out on a total stranger.  
And she's drifting to that heady spot. 
EVE
I feel disconnected to everything 
that was. Like I'm floating through 
time with no past and no future. 
There's only now.
She takes a long moment, studies his face. Makes a decision.
EVE (CONT'D)
Would you like to sleep with me?
Eduardo's voice, an aching whisper. *
EDUARDO *
Yes.
CUT TO:
INT. A HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
Eduardo and Eve find themselves alone in the center of an *
oversized room.
Eduardo can’t seem to make his move. Eve’s touched by his *
boyishness. She gently kisses his hand and places it on her 
breast.
INTERNAL VOICE
The body is such a lonely vessel.
Eduardo touches her skin, marvels at the feel. Yearns for her.*
INTERNAL VOICE (CONT'D)
Our souls are so isolated and they 
ache to join with other souls.
They kiss, slowly and with a strange tenderness for all the 
swelling libido.
INTERNAL VOICE (CONT'D)
But the flesh is a wall. It keeps us 
so far apart.
Their arms lock around each other and the first hungry, 
animal kiss begins.
INTERNAL VOICE
The moments we have of true 
happiness...EDUARDO (cont'd)52."
"ALL THROUGHT THE NIGHT - AS IF IN A DREAM - *
INTERNAL VOICE (CONT’D)
...are when the barriers are down and 
something is shared.
A MAN AND WOMAN TRY TO BREAK THROUGH THE WALLS THAT *
SEPARATE THEIR SOULS -- *
INTERNAL VOICE (CONT’D)
That’s when the loneliness 
disappears...
Eduardo and Eve, faces masks of sweet agony. *
INTERNAL VOICE (CONT’D)
But all the pain that must be 
killed is so deeply embedded, the 
good is often killed with it.
Man and woman shudder together. Souls closer.
CUT TO:
INT. EIGHTH DISTRICT POLICE STATION - NIGHT
The homicide office is quiet. Gilbert sneaks into Captain 
Bob's office. *
INT. CLOVIS' OFFICE - NIGHT
Gilbert searches through the desk. No luck. He finds the key 
to his file cabinet. Unlocks it and rummages. Something 
catches his eye.
GILBERT SEES THE KEYCHAIN that Eduardo asked about. He takes a *
picture of it with his phone. *
THROUGH THE 
WINDOW:
EXT. POLICE PARKING LOT - NIGHT
Clovis parks his car and heads into the station.
INT. CLOVIS'S OFFICE - SAME TIME
Gilbert looks through Clovis' police reports.53."
"INT. THE WATCH COMMANDER'S STATION
Clovis makes small talk.
GILBERT  
Finds the lab report. Snaps pix.
CLOVIS  
Comes up the stairs, heading for his office.
GILBERT  
Locks the file cabinet and puts the key back in Clovis's 
drawer just as:
Clovis enters. Gilbert sits on the end of his desk.
CLOVIS
What are you doing in my office?
GILBERT
Waiting for you.
CLOVIS
How'd you know I was coming in?
GILBERT
I heard you jawing with the watch 
commander.
Clovis eyes him suspiciously. Gilbert conspiratorially pushes 
the door closed.
GILBERT
You told me to report everything 
that Castro is up to. *
CLOVIS
What you got?
GILBERT
He went to that bar yesterday because 
Michael Weber was with some gay 
hustler the night he got killed. That 
bartender that Eduardo shot's his *
pimp.
CLOVIS
I already knew all that. Why you 
telling me what I already know?54."
"GILBERT
I don't know what you know, sir. 
Because you don't tell me what you 
know.
A stand off. Clovis nods and smiles.
CLOVIS
That's true, Gilbert, I don't.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAWN
Newborn light seeps across the river. Eduardo awakens to an *
empty bed. He looks over and sees Eve wrapped in a sheet, 
perched at the window waiting on the first rays of the day.
EDUARDO *
What are you doing?
EVE
Reminding myself.
EDUARDO *
Of what?
EVE
That every day is a chance to wake up 
new. Before we remember and let the 
ghosts take over.
EDUARDO *
Those ghosts are part of who we are.
EVE
Who we are? Two days ago you were the 
worst man I'd ever seen. Just another 
bully with a badge taking out his 
resentment on the world.
EDUARDO *
I made that good an impression?
She walks over to him, touches his hair.
EVE
The sun rises and sets a couple of 
times and here you are. The gentleman 
who rescued me from indignity, and 
makes love to me in a way that gives 
me hope.
Eduardo is speechless. *55."
"EVE
You see? Every day is a fresh chance.
She kisses his eyes and Eduardo is a new child. *
CUT TO:
INT. EDUARDO'S HOUSE - MORNING *
Eduardo's asleep in his rocking chair. He's awakened by *
UNRELENTING POUNDING ON HIS DOOR. He drags over and opens up. 
It's Gilbert carrying two coffees and a paper bag tucked under 
his arm. Eduardo takes the coffee and drops on to the couch. *
EDUARDO *
What happened with the last race?
GILBERT
Your horse won. But I spent your 
winnings on these overpriced coffees.
Eduardo grins, lights a cigarette. *
GILBERT
What was Mrs. Garon doing at the 
track by herself?
EDUARDO *
Spying on hubby. He was there messing *
around with a pretty young thing. *
Gil studies him. Eduardo sips his coffee. *
EDUARDO *
You nervous about me fooling with a *
murder suspect?
GILBERT
Oh, hell no. She didn't kill nobody.
EDUARDO *
What makes you so sure?
GILBERT
Your cheeks are rosy.
EDUARDO *
Not my only rosy part. *
Quick grins.
GILBERT
Edu and Eve, like a couple a high *
school sweethearts. She's gonna 
change your life.56."
"Eduardo gets an ice pack from the freezer; puts it on his *
neck.
GILBERT
I brought something to go with your 
morning coffee.
Gilbert shows him the picture of the keychain on his cell 
phone.
EDUARDO *
That's the keychain I bagged. Where 
was it?
GILBERT
I searched Captain Bob's office last 
night. It was in his file cabinet. I 
couldn't take it so I snapped a 
picture for you.
EDUARDO *
You searched Captain Bob's office? 
I'm seeing you in a whole new light, 
Officer Big Balls.
Gilbert grins.
GILBERT
Oh, that light's about to get 
brighter.
He dumps a stack of files on the table. Eduardo opens the *
first one and goes wide eyed when he sees:
CRIME REPORTS
FROM TWO OTHER MURDERS. Both with nude men, hanging above four 
chairs. Blood bucket at the foot of each of the chairs.*
Eduardo looks at photos of the men, reads the evidence log. *
His eyes widen.
EDUARDO *
There's two other murders here. 
They're covering up a serial killer? *
GILBERT
They're listed as missing persons. 
Cases were assigned to Hunsman and 
Klein and they've been working it 
exclusively.
Eduardo can't believe what he's looking at. *57."
"EDUARDO *
How can they keep something like this 
under wraps? *
GILBERT
The Eight District Precinct is very 
different than the one you work at.
It's a private police department. 
They play it like they protect and 
serve the public, but that's the 
show. They protect and serve the 
bosses of this city.
EDUARDO *
That's true with every department. 
The power players always get more 
protection.
GILBERT
Not like this. Clovis got his own 
inner circle, a police department 
within the police department. And you *
and me can't join.
Eduardo considers long and hard, finally: *
EDUARDO *
Well, we're just gonna have to solve *
this one without them. You on board? *
GILBERT
Oh hell, yes.
Eduardo scoops up the files and brings him into the spare *
bedroom which is a quasi office space.
EDUARDO *
We'll work outta my house. Anybody 
we talk to about these other two, 
its always gotta be referenced as 
a missing persons. They can't know 
what we're up to.
GILBERT
Damn right, they can't. Or it's our 
asses frying in pure lard. *
Eduardo grabs a spare key off a wall hook and tosses it to *
Gil.
GILBERT
My own key? Not worried about your 
liquor cabinet?
EDUARDO *
It's always empty.58."
"Shared smiles. Partners.
EDUARDO *
I told you we're gonna be stars.
GILBERT
Or cellmates. *
EDUARDO *
Let's get these photos up and then we 
gotta cross reference everything 
these victims had in common. And I 
mean everything.
GILBERT
My laptop's in the car. You have 
wifi?
EDUARDO *
Came with the cable package. *
A SERIES OF CUTS - AS THE DAY PROGRESSES
Eduardo and Gilbert working on the material. *
Eduardo rearranges photos. Reads crime reports. *
Gilbert on his laptop.
Eduardo makes pots of coffee. *
They share the last cigarette.
Gilbert prints a bunch of stuff from his laptop.
Eduardo steps back and stares at the photos. *
EDUARDO *
Who wears ties?
GILBERT
(shrugs)
Businessmen. *
Eduardo shakes his head. *
EDUARDO *
Daddies wear ties. This killer's 
trauma is connected to his father.
Gilbert sits upright, nods.
GILBERT
Yeah, I can go with that.59."
"EDUARDO *
Cuttin' out their tongues means these 
fathers are liars.
GILBERT
Lying daddies makes me think of my 
pastors.
EDUARDO *
Yeah. But unless those buckets are 
filled with the blood of Christ I'm 
guessing it's not that kind of 
father. Who'd want to kill a lying 
father?
GILBERT
I don't know, man. My father died *
when I was ten. I'd take my daddy 
anyway I could get him.
FLASHCUT TO:*
A MAN WITH A BULLET IN HIS HEAD *
Slowly pitches over on to a linoleum floor. *
BACK TO:*
EDUARDO AND GILBERT *
Staring wordlessly at the photos. Eduardo breaks the *
silence. *
EDUARDO *
There's a lotta pain here. It's *
bigger than the freaky shit. This is 
bone deep pain we all feel.
GILBERT
There's always bone deep pain with a 
psycho. He doesn't do this shit cause 
he's feeling lighthearted.
Eduardo turns to Gilbert, mock hurt. *
EDUARDO *
Damn, I thought I was making a break 
through and you just brought the *
clouds. *
Gilbert smiles, scoops up his printouts.
GILBERT
Back to real police work. The victims 
had a lot in common. 
(MORE)60."
"(reads)
All hugely successful. All high end 
investors. All involved in real 
estate. All married with children. 
All members of the same church.
EDUARDO *
Which church?
GILBERT
St. Charles Baptist.
(continues reading)
They were all members of the same 
country club, too.
EDUARDO *
The Beaumont?
GILBERT
Say that. *
INT. THE BEAUMONT COUNTRY CLUB - DAY
New Orleans elite. Grand foyer. White gloves on the butlers. 
Eduardo waits in a chair. The MANAGER comes over to him. *
Eduardo discreetly shows his badge. *
MANAGER
Please, put your badge away, officer.
EDUARDO *
Detective.
MANAGER
Detective, I'm sorry, but I can't let 
you bother our members without a *
warrant.
EDUARDO *
Make an exception. *
EVE
(o.s.)
Eduardo? *
He turns round to find Eve entering with COUNCILMAN MONTAGUE 
""MONTY"" WALLACE, silver fox New Orleans Grand Ol' Patriarch.
EVE
Eduardo, what are you doing here? *
EDUARDO *
Police business.
MANAGER
Which he's just concluded.GILBERT (cont'd)61."
"EVE
Eduardo, this is my dear friend, *
Monty Wallace. Monty, this is 
Detective Eduardo Castro. *
MONTAGUE
How do you do, Detective?
They shake hands.
EDUARDO *
Pleasure to meet you, sir.
MONTAGUE
Can I invite you to join us?
Before Eduardo can refuse, Eve intervenes. *
EVE
Yes, you can. Eduardo's the smartest *
detective in New Orleans and he has 
no political friends.
MONTAGUE
We'll remedy that right now.
Montague nods to the Manager who discreetly dematerializes.
CUT TO:
INT. THE DINING ROOM - DAY
Montague holds court with Eduardo and Eve on either side of *
him. A waiter stands discreetly at the ready, holding a large 
silver cocktail shaker.
MONTAGUE
The sazerac is a perfect libation. I 
always drink one before lunch. And 
one before my dinner.
EVE
Well, I never drink before five and 
I'm not about to change that.
EDUARDO *
Always willing to alter my routine, 
so I'll join you.
MONTAGUE
Excellent, Detective. I like your 
friend, Eve.
EVE
I like him, too.62."
"MONTAGUE
Then you won't refuse to drink with 
him. Alphonse, sazeracs all round.
The waiter nods and fills three glasses.
MONTAGUE
Now do tell what business brought you 
into conflict with the manager of 
this august establishment?
EDUARDO *
No conflict. I'm just doing leg work 
on a case. Too boring to go into.
MONTAGUE
There's nothing boring about what you 
do. And you carry yourself like a 
homicide man.
Eduardo nods. *
EDUARDO *
Impressive, sir. You'd make a fine 
detective.
MONTAGUE
Better businessman.
EVE
Oh, stop playing coy, Eduardo. Tell *
us some little tidbit. Maybe we know 
something.
EDUARDO *
I'm helping out with some missing *
persons. They were members of this *
club.
MONTAGUE
I knew them well. Have there been any 
breakthroughs?
Eduardo grins. *
EDUARDO *
I just arrived on the scene. I'll *
need a day or two to wrap it up.
MONTAGUE
Well, then we can rest easy.
He offers his glass up for toasts. Eduardo notices his host is *
wearing A RING WITH THE SAME INSCRIPTION AS THE KEYCHAIN FROM 
THE MURDER.63."
"EDUARDO *
Nice ring.
Monty smiles and touches it.
MONTAGUE
My Fundator Abbas shield?
EDUARDO *
What's it mean?
MONTAGUE
Fundator Abbas means Founding 
Fathers. It was a fraternity of the 
men who built this city. Now, its a 
silly affectation, no more meaningful 
than the Shriners or the Rotary Club. 
CUT TO:
INT. EVERETT'S HOUSE - DAY
Shoes off and sipping a beer, Gilbert listens to Eduardo's *
report.
GILBERT
You met Montague Wallace? Now that's 
a big lying daddy worth hating.
EDUARDO *
Charming as my Sunday school teacher.
GILBERT
You remember them petitions that my 
church ladies were circulating? 
They're trying to stop one of Big 
Daddy Montague's developments. *
EDUARDO *
Stopping Montague is like trying to *
hold back Katrina.
GILBERT
Yeah, except Katrina eventually died 
out. That old sumbitch just keeps 
rolling.
EDUARDO *
You're gonna love this. He was *
wearing a ring that had the same 
symbol as the keychain Captain Bob 
stole outta my evidence.
GILBERT
You're fuckin' wit me.64."
"EDUARDO *
It's a fraternity, like the Shriners.
GILBERT
They wear them silly hats?
Eduardo steals the last swig of Gilbert's beer. *
EDUARDO *
Say that!
CUT TO:
INT. EDUARDO AND GIL'S WORKROOM - DAY *
Eduardo's attention is on the crime photos. Something nudges *
him.
EDUARDO *
Hey, I know this is a crazy 
thought...
GILBERT
Come on, I'm waiting on crazy.
EDUARDO *
Well, these big shots are always 
double crossing each other. You think 
one of 'em could've had these guys 
killed and had it all dressed up to 
throw off the scent?
GILBERT
That's beyond crazy, Eduardo. You see *
how meticulous these killing rituals 
are? That's not just dress up crazy. 
That's bone marrow crazy.
EDUARDO *
Yeah, and sometimes crazy makes 
sense.
GILBERT
Bullshit.
EXT. HOTEL - EVENING
A posh hotel in French Quarter.
EVE (O.S.)
I'd like to say goodbye to all of my 
bullshit.65."
"INT. HOTEL BAR - EVENING
Eduardo and Eve are tucked into a dark, sexy bar on the ground *
floor of a luxury hotel.
EDUARDO *
It takes a whole lot of bullshit to 
get what we want from each other.
He takes another drink. She watches him.
EVE
Want and need are two different 
things. Maybe the secret is letting 
go of the wants and being happy with 
the needs.
(for example)
A person wants sex, but they need 
love.
EDUARDO *
Hell, I want love, but I need sex.
She giggles. He waves for more drinks.
EDUARDO (CONT'D) *
What do you want that you think you 
need?
EVE
Money.
EDUARDO *
Everybody needs to provide for the 
basics.
She nods her head, but she's somewhere else.
EVE
My father made enough to provide more 
than that. But he hated his life. He 
hated his job and the men he worked 
for. He hated being the meal ticket 
for a family. Two weeks vacation a 
year wasn't enough to stop the hate *
from eating him alive. *
Eduardo nods, don't he know. *
EVE (CONT'D)
I detest that kind of slavery. And 
the only answer that I can see is 
money.
EDUARDO *
Well, you've got plenty of it now.66."
"Eve reflects on the built-in irony.
EVE
I don't want to wind up married to a 
guy like my father. And I don't want 
to be some useless house-frau 
suddenly exposed to the job market at 
forty.
A long, suspicious moment in Eduardo's eyes. He takes it *
personally.
EDUARDO *
You sayin' you don't want to divorce 
your husband?
EVE
Oh, I'm going to leave him. I'm just 
afraid of coming out of it with 
nothing.
Eduardo's confused. She can guess his next question. *
EVE (CONT'D)
My husband's leveraged everything 
into a deal that's going to ruin him. 
He thinks he can pull it off, but he 
doesn't have the savvy. It was 
Michael's game and David thinks he 
can play it.
Eduardo shakes his head to the god of folly, takes another *
sip, regards her for a moment. 
EDUARDO *
I don't think you need money, Eve. *
You just need someone to touch your 
face.
He reaches over and strokes her cheek. She holds his hand 
there.
EXT. HOTEL - NIGHT
Eve's Jaguar is parked out front. Eduardo tenderly kisses her, *
goodnight. 
TELEPHOTO POV
Somebody’s watching Eduardo and Eve. We hear slow even *
BREATHING and CLICKING OF A CAMERA SHUTTER. Eve touches 
Eduardo's hand and smiles appreciatively. *67."
"Then she gets into her car and Eduardo watches her drive away *
as we are enveloped in BREATHING.

Winding beneath the overgrowth of cypress and cottonwoods. The 
tiny road mere inches from being engulfed by swamp.

Eduardo spots another turn off and wends his way to a *
Sheriff's Office.

A small morgue. Deputy Marcum shows Eduardo the PARTIALLY *
DECOMPOSED CORPSE OF DEWAYNE SHAYES. He points to a ridge of 
bruises and burn marks along his back side.
DEPUTY MARCUM
This look familiar to you?
QUICK FLASHBACK -- HEADLESS CORPSE
Being examined by Eduardo, Clyde and Remi. Close on marks *
along the lower ribs.

Gilbert is huddled over some paperwork at his desk. Detective 
Klein barges in. Gilbert quickly slams the file shut.
KLEIN
What the hell you bein' so secretive 
about?
GILBERT
(barks)
I stick my nose in your business?
Klein is taken aback by Gil's aggression. He holds up his 
arms.
KLEIN
Easy there, tiger. Don't want no 
homicides up in here today.
Klein grins and shakes his head as he leaves the wound up man.
CUT TO:
INT. RUCHON'S BAR - DAY
Ruchon is behind the bar, clumsily getting ready for the day 
with his bandaged hand. He freezes when he sees Eduardo enter.*
RUCHON
Oh no! No, no, no! *
EDUARDO *
I just wanna talk. *
Ruchon eyes him warily.
EDUARDO *
I know you send boys out to them 
parties. Tell me what goes on back *
there.
Ruchon waits; considers, then:
RUCHON
It's for dem high-ups. You unnastand? 
Dem boys can't be touched.

"Dey got a camp back there in Bayou 
Shell. Called Calvaria Wood.
As Ruchon speaks we see:
IMAGES OF CALVARIA WOOD
The place where Clovis killed Dewayne Shayes. The camp grounds 
are still. Boy Scout innocent. Peaceful.
RUCHON
(v.o.)
Couple times a year they let it all 
hang out. Anything goes.
EDUARDO *
(v.o.)
What kind of anything?
We see members of the club arriving wearing their country club 
safari gear. Servants carry in cases of alcohol and boxes of 
steaks.
RUCHON
(v.o.)
Dey start with a prayer circle. Some 
big daddy dildo reads some bible 
verses. Dey have little bullshit 
conferences and talk 'bout their 
civic responsibilities. Future deals.
Around the conference table, MONTAGUE ""MONTY"" WALLACE, the 
senior big shot, holds court. The servants are all gone.
RUCHON
(v.o.)
Den dey light a bonfire and have some 
initiation rituals.
The men are gathered around a central bonfire. A tiny effigy 
is thrown into the flames.

Satanic?
RUCHON
They humiliation freaks. Some a dem

"It's like a bunch of college boys 
hazing some poor sumbitches who wanna 
join dey club. But one poor sumbitch 
doesn't make the cut and he gets put 
on. Real bad.
EDUARDO *
Details.
RUCHON
I hear'd it's like running a 
gauntlet. The poor fool who can't cut 
the mustard is stripped down and 
hunted through dem swamps. If they 
catch him, they bring him back to 
camp and fuck wit' him, then they 
drop him bare ass on the road back to 
town.
Naked man is lashed to a pole and carried like an animal.
EDUARDO *
They ever kill anybody?
Ruchon laughs and shrugs.
RUCHON
If dey did, dey wouldn't have to 
worry much 'bout it.
Eduardo tilts his head down, reflectively. *

got caught by Klein.
EDUARDO *
From Captain Bob's files?
GILBERT
I can only copy a few at a time.
EDUARDO *
You better back off. You're gonna get *
caught.
GILBERT
Hell, if Bob caught me I'd look worse 
than one of these poor sumbitches.RUCHON (cont'd)71."
"He produces a fresh stack of gruesome crime photos.  Eduardo *
takes the stack, taken aback by the exquisite composition of 
each shot. EACH ONE A PERFECTLY FRAMED, VIVIDLY DETAILED 
DEPICTION OF A HANGING CORPSE.
EDUARDO *
Whoah, I've never seen crime scene 
photos like this.
Eduardo loses himself in the images, like an art student at *
the Louvre.
EDUARDO *
They're like works of art, Gilbert. 
Who took 'em?
Gilbert shrugs.
GILBERT
Probably some young man in the crime 
scene unit with artistic aspirations.
Eduardo places each photo up on the wall, transfixed by their *
eerie beauty.
EDUARDO *
Say that.
ALL DAY THE TWO MEN WORK
Eduardo staring at combinations of the photos, continually *
rearranging them. 
Gilbert works away on his laptop, completely engrossed.
GILBERT
Look at this, Eduardo. *
The three perfect crime photos are scanned into his computer. 
Gilbert draws an oblong line around them.
GILBERT
That's a cruciform. It's the classic 
shape for a Christian Sanctuary. 
Check it out.
Eduardo watches. Gilbert superimposes a church with stained *
glass windows over the crime photos.
EDUARDO *
What's it mean?
GILBERT
I don't fuckin' know. But it's cool 
as shit.72."
"Eduardo play smacks him in the back of the head. *
EDUARDO *
Go back to playing video games.
THEY CONTINUE WORKING - HOURS PASS
Coffee cups pile up. Ash trays fill.
Eduardo keeps staring at the three new photos. *
EDUARDO *
See where the body's placed over each 
chair?
Eduardo points to the photos of each crime scene. *
EDUARDO *
That's the first murder. Body's over 
the first chair. The second. Over the 
second. And the third.
Gilbert follows the progression. First corpse over the first 
chair. Second. And third. He points to the fourth empty chair.
EDUARDO *
There's gonna be one more club member 
killed.
Gilbert's jaw gapes. He stares at the photos.
EDUARDO *
You see?
GILBERT
Yeah, I see.
But something else has caught Gilbert's attention.
EDUARDO *
What? What is it?
GILBERT
Look at the hands.
He points to the first photo.
EDUARDO *
What? I don't see anything.
GILBERT
Look at the hands of the victims. 
Check out the first one. Five fingers 
on his open hand. His other hand is 
closed.73."
"Gilbert writes down the number 5 on his pad.
GILBERT
Second victim. Open right hand. Five 
fingers. But look at the left hand, 
three fingers showing, two curled 
under. Five plus three. That's eight.
Gilbert writes down the number 8.
GILBERT
And the last guy. Two open hands. Ten 
fingers.
Gilbert writes down a ten. He holds it up to show Eduardo. *
58:10.
EDUARDO *
Bible verse?
GILBERT
One of the most famous. Any altar boy 
in this city can quote Psalm 58:10. 
""The righteous shall rejoice when he 
sees vengeance. He shall bathe his 
feet in the blood of the wicked.""
Gilbert stabs a finger at the tubs of blood beneath each 
victim.

Eve arrives with a bag of Asian takeout. She enters, takes in

self-conscious.
EDUARDO *
I don’t spend much time here.
EVE
I can see why.
EDUARDO *
Hey, I’m a cop. This is all I can 
afford.
EVE
I’ve had worse. It just seems like no 
one lives here. There’s no art on the 
wall, no family pictures. No plants. 
Not a single book.74."
"Eduardo can’t deny the lifelessness of his dwelling. He looks *
around at the dead room and realizes how empty his life is.
Eve tries to lighten it up a bit.

Eduardo offers a vulnerable smile. She begins unpacking the *
take out.
INT. EVERETT'S HOUSE - LATER
Eduardo and Eve sit at the table, chewing mouthfuls of *
noodles. She sips wine. He scotch. Eve’s done her best to make 
the table cozy. The lights are low and she’s got a candle 
shoved into a wine bottle.
Something in Eduardo's face catches Eve and she stops to *
watch him. He feels her stare; looks up from his food. *
EVE
You don’t have the eyes of a killer.
EDUARDO *
What do you think a killer’s eyes 
look like?
EVE
You tell me.
EDUARDO *
They look like anybody else’s. Cause 
everyone’s a potential killer. The 
thing you want to know about is a 
psycho’s eyes.
(teasing)
What’s it like to face a mass 
murderer? To look into the eyes of an 
insane killer?
She puts down her fork and leans forward, expectantly.
EVE
Yes?
EDUARDO *
(shrugs)
Same as anybody.
He goes back to his food, amused by playing with her.
EVE
You’re no fun.75."
"EDUARDO *
Oh, this is supposed to be fun? I 
thought you wanted scary. You want me 
to tell you what scares me?
(leaves it hanging, then)
Cool people scare me. The kind that 
can lay on a block of ice without *
even working up to it. You know the 
type?
EVE
Like when I froze you out at the 
house?
Eduardo nods, oh yeah. That one stung. *
EVE (CONT'D)
You know what everybody at the 
country club really wants?
She pauses to make long eye contact.
EVE (CONT’D)
To touch the fire.
She comes around the table and hungrily devours him. They 
slide to the floor, scorching everything in their path.
INT. EVERETT'S HOUSE- LATER
Eduardo snoozes. Eve drifts through his house, taking in the *
life of Eduardo Castro. *
She wanders into his work room. Freezes when she sees the 
crime scene photos. She turns, startled by Eduardo standing in *
the door way.
EDUARDO *
Don't stare at them, Eve. They scar.
He takes her hand and leads her away.

DEPUTY MARCUM
It's off limits. That's the word from

we're called. And we never been 
called.
EDUARDO *
I hear they get up to some crazy 
shit.
DEPUTY MARCUM
Don't we all.
EDUARDO *
Nothing ever spilled out beyond the 
camp? DUI's? Accidents?
DEPUTY MARCUM
Picked up a feller there, must be 
four, five years ago. Bare ass and 
shivering. Bunch a marks all over 
him. But he wouldn't say nothing. We 
wrapped him in blankets. Wouldn't let 
us bring him home. So we dropped him 
at his car and nobody heard from him 
again.
EDUARDO *
He got a name?
Marcum considers, shrugs, why not?
EDUARDO *

Atlee Morrisey?
EXT. A MODEST OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
Eduardo intercepts ATLEE MORRISEY, a plain looking *
businessman, timid demeanor and damage in his eyes. The man 
cautiously nods.
EDUARDO *
I'm Detective Castro. I need to ask *
you a couple of questions.
ATLEE
What's wrong?77."
"EDUARDO *
Nothing for you to worry about. I'm 
investigating some problems out at 
Calvaria Wood and I know you had an 
unpleasant experience there.
Atlee's face says this is not a subject he wishes to discuss.
ATLEE
Sir, it was six years ago and I do 
not wish to speak about it. Please.
Eduardo can see the scars run deep. *
EDUARDO *
Atlee. I know what them bastards get *
up to.
ATLEE
It won't do you or me one bit of good 
to discuss what they do at that camp.
EDUARDO *
Do you know any other men who went 
through what you went through?
ATLEE
No, I truly don't. But there's no 
shortage of fools who want to be part 
of the Fondling Fathers.
He pronounces these words with ancient bitterness.
EDUARDO *
They ever killed anybody?
Atlee remembers back, his mouth tightens. But he says nothing. 
His shoulders give a half hearted shrug.
EDUARDO *
You ever think about getting revenge 
on any of those fellers?
Atlee looks him right in the eye.
ATLEE
Every day of my life. But who'd take 
care of my family?
Eduardo understands. *
EDUARDO *
Thank you, Mr. Morrisey. Sorry to 
bring up painful memories.
He shoves his card in Atlee's chest pocket.78."

there's a pain that nobody can reach. 
A pain that's only his.79."

Hey, man, don't lay this shit on me.

Gentlemen, thank you for meeting with

Lakeshore. I recently discovered that 
this is one of three killings that 
have been kept quiet by the Eighth 
District's homicide department.
Surprised looks passed among his superiors.
CHIEF KROLL
For reasons that remain classified, 
Captain Clovis has handled this 
investigation internally.
EDUARDO *
That discretion probably cost more 
lives. I've come here to ask which is 
more important: keeping the 
investigation discreet or catching 
the killer?
CHIEF KROLL
You're out of line, detective.
EDUARDO *
Yes, I am, sir. Do you want me to 
continue?
Chief Kroll nods for him to go on.
EDUARDO *
There's going to be one more club 
member killed.
CAPTAIN LYNCH
How in the hell do you know that?
EDUARDO *
Four chairs. First victim hanging 
above the first chair. Second victim 
over the second. Third over the  
third. One chair left.
CHIEF KROLL
Who's doing this, Detective?
EDUARDO *
This killer's pathology is connected 
to his father. That's why he's come 
after the Founding Fathers.

Clovis smirks ironically and drains his glass.
CLOVIS
I've spent my entire career

mockery of my existence.
(turns to Eduardo) *
Now, I know you're not stupid. But I 
can see you're overconfident. And 
that's a mistake. Don't think banging 
a rich man's wife is going to secure 
your future.
Eduardo's eyes burn into him. *88."
"EDUARDO *
Leave her out of it.
CLOVIS
You think everybody here doesn't know 
what's going on with you and the Prom 
Queen? We see it happen at every one 
of these parties.
(grins bitterly)
Look in there, Eduardo. Every one of *
those broken former debutantes *
regularly finds a new prince to dress *
up in fine suits and come and rescue *
their dull existence. But they always 
go back to their husbands. That's the 
natural order of things.
Eduardo leaves the terrace; heads for the front door. *
Eve intercepts him. Pulls him into an alcove.
EVE
Where are you going?
EDUARDO *
Home.
She can see something's wrong.
EVE
The hell you are. I've talked you up 
to some powerful men and now it's 
time for you to perform.
EDUARDO *
Ain't gonna happen.
He starts to leave. She blocks his path.
EVE
What's wrong with you, Eduardo? *
Afraid of a little success?
Eve senses that old male devil rearing its ugly head.
EDUARDO (CONT’D) *
What are you playing at, Eve? 
Dressing me like your husband. 
Pushing me up in society. You re-
creating me so I can slip right into 
David's shoes and no one will notice?
His last comment burns. She glares at him.
EVE
Fuck you, Eduardo. *89."
"She turns and goes back to her friends. Eduardo watches for a *
moment and leaves.
David Garon watches the little scene and smugly sucks his 
cigar.
CUT TO:
EXT. GARON MANSION - NIGHT
The house is dark and deathly silent. Eve’s Rover is parked 
there. A Mercedes slips into the drive and stops in front of 
the house. David Garon emerges and heads inside. 
ACROSS THE STREET
Eduardo watches miserably from the front seat of his Mustang. *
He slugs from a bottle of scotch, rubs his angry temples, and 
lets his head fall back on the seat.
INT. EVE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Eve sits at her dressing table, still in her party gown. She 
stares at the woman in her mirror. A sad picture of raccoon 
mascara and defeat.
David enters.  Eve grabs a jar of moisturizer and pretends to 
be cleaning up for bed. David undoes his tie and cruises the 
bedroom in a lasciviously playful mood.
DAVID
Heck of a party. Can't fathom why you 
left so soon.
Eve's pretends he doesn't exist. She removes her earrings. 
David reaches over and lewdly runs his fingers along her 
neck. 
EVE
I'm tired.
She tries to ignore him, but his hands begin roving. He buzzes 
her ear.
DAVID
You're not upset because your 
boyfriend left early, are you?
EVE
Get out of my room, David.
She ignores him and heads for the bathroom. He intercepts her 
from behind, locking his arms around her waist.90."
"DAVID
It must be a masochistic thing, 
Sweetness, but thinking about another 
man humping my wife makes me really 
excited.
He begins pawing up her body. She tries to pull away.
EVE
David, stop this, you're drunk.
DAVID
Stop playing innocent, Eve. We're 
both dirty little adulterers and 
before we head into divorce court, I 
want one last Rumble in Your Jungle. *
EVE
I don't want you, David!
She struggles to get free. He pins her face down on a table.
DAVID
That's all right. There were times I 
didn't want you, but I performed to 
make you happy.
EVE
Fuck you! *
DAVID
Rape is inevitable, so try to enjoy 
it.
He hikes up her dress, still pinning her, face down.
EVE
Don't do this, David.
He tears off her panties, stares hungrily at her smooth, round 
ass. She tries to lash out but his full weight traps her.
EVE (CONT'D)
Stop!!!
DAVID
That's right, baby. Tell me how you 
feel.
Her face is pressed against the hardwood table. She groans 
involuntarily as he invades her.
EVE
You fucking creep! I could kill you!! *
Her breath heaves in and out. She clenches her teeth, enduring 
the relentless pumping. 91."
"DAVID
Yes, baby. Tell me more. Tell me 
about your boyfriend. Does he use 
handcuffs on you?
EVE
(spits)
No.
DAVID
Oh, it's completely romantic, is it?
EVE
Yes.
Her anger is massive. She wants to hurt him any way she can. 
His face oozes sadistic pleasure. Her head explodes with 
imprisoned torture. 
DAVID
How does he fuck you?
EVE
Sweetly. Like you never could.
He slaps the side of her face and keeps riding her.
DAVID
Yes, bitch. Tell me more. *
She's desperate for escape; pretends she's getting off on it.
EVE
He likes to do it from behind. 
David's eyes glow hungrily.
DAVID
Like I'm doing it?
EVE
Yes.
DAVID
What else does he like?
EVE
He likes when I reach my hands back 
and--
She works her hands behind her and--
DAVID SCREAMS, eyes bulging with insane agony as she rips at 
his testicles. He falls to the floor--92."
"EVE claws for a weapon and grabs a lamp, just as David comes 
at her-- she smashes the lamp across the side of his face, 
breaking his cheekbone and dropping him to the floor--
EVE staggers from the room as fast as she can. We hear her 
FOOTSTEPS retreating--
DAVID groans and stumbles across the room. He's moving past 
pain and disorientation into rage.
DAVID
You're dead, bitch!
Clutching his cheek, he staggers across the room.
CUT TO:
EXT. EVERETT'S CAR - NIGHT
Still sitting unnoticed across the street from the Garon’s 
house. The driver's seat is empty.
IMAGES UNFOLD:
David Garon on his knees. Eyes wide in horror. A gun invades 
his mouth and --
Garon falls backward as the back of his skull erupts brains

The house is still. Eve's car is gone from the motor court.
Eduardo's car is still parked out front. He awakens in the *
passenger seat and slowly pulls himself up.93."
"He staggers over to the seemingly peaceful house; confused. 
Something strange plays in his head. He notices the huge front 
door is open. He sees that Eve's car is gone.
Eduardo goes into the house, his cop's sense kicking in and *
suddenly he's taking the steps two at a time until he comes 
into:
INT. EVE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Eduardo's stops in his tracks at the doorway-- His face *
contorts, shocked by --
Propped up against Eve's bed is David Garon's nude body. The 
left side of his face is bashed in.  The wall is spattered 
with blood.
Eduardo slowly takes in the crime scene. *
EDUARDO *
Eve?
He tries to reconstruct the scene. But it only increases the 
throbbing in his skull.
EDUARDO (CONT'D) *
This is too sloppy!
Eduardo's head pounds. He spins around, panicked. Then, he *
makes up his mind. He hoists the corpse and begins 
doctoring the crime scene.
CUT TO:
EXT. MISSISSIPPI COAST - MORNING
Eve’s car moves along the empty coastal road.

bowels of the house.
INT. GARON MANSION - LATER
The place is swarming with detectives. Hunsman directs the 
investigation. Gil is also on the scene.
Eduardo staggers in, still in his rumpled suit, hungover, *
looking and smelling like serious shit.94."
"The stunned cops clear out of his way as he surveys the crime 
scene. Eduardo leans a hand against the bedpost and takes in *
the corpse. Hunsman is inspecting the body when he spots 
Eduardo. Klein takes out his cellphone and makes a call.*
HUNSMAN
Put your gloves on, man!
Eduardo notices his hand and yanks it back. Gil comes over and *
hands him a pair of gloves.
GIL
You okay?
Eduardo nods. The other detectives stare at Eduardo. *
EDUARDO *
What’s the matter, none of you boys 
ever had a late night?
He clumsily pulls on the gloves and staggers through the crime 
scene. Klein's seen enough of his shit.
KLEIN
Dammit Castro, why don't you drag *
your dick over the crime scene, you 
fucking asshole!
Eduardo whirls and smashes Klein in the face. Klein staggers *
back, blood streaming from his broken nose. He tackles 
Eduardo. They furiously go at each other -- the other cops *
pull them apart.
EXT. GARON MANSION - MOMENTS LATER
Gilbert escorts Eduardo to his car. *
GILBERT
What the hell happened to you?
EDUARDO *
Hey, I'm hungover and I hate when my 
girlfriends commit sloppy murders.
GILBERT
You don't know she did it.
EDUARDO *
(snaps)
Come on, Gilbert. If you're ever 
gonna be more than a department 
flunky, open your damn eyes.
Gilbert recoils. That was low. Eduardo knows it. But he's too *
fucked up to address it now.95."
"EDUARDO (CONT'D) *
I better go clean myself up.
He attempts an apologetic clap on Gil's shoulder. But it's not

Eve emerges from the bathroom, towel wrapped round her hair,

lights up.

Eduardo huddles with Cruvere, the M.E. *
CRUVERE
We found a woman's pubic hairs mixed 
with David Garon's. They matched it 
to hair samples in Eve Garon's 
closet. They were having intercourse 
right before he was killed. They also 
found her fingerprints on fragments 
of the lamp that cracked his cheek.
Eduardo nods, bitterly. He's about to ask a question when *
Clovis barges in flanked by Hunsman.
CLOVIS
What are you doing here, Eduardo? *
EDUARDO *
I'm in charge of the investigation.
CLOVIS
Not since forty-five minutes ago, by 
order of City Hall. Now get your ass 
out of my autopsy.
Eduardo wordlessly leaves, beaten. Clovis turns to Cruvere.*
CLOVIS
What am I looking at, Angelo?
CRUVERE
This one's the same as the Weber 
murder and completely different. Same 
small caliber gunshot wound. 
(MORE)97."
"Exact same angle as the Weber 
shooting. Same exit wound. Same knee 
abrasions. But this guy's a total 
mess. His cheek was fractured with a 
lamp or a vase. We found slivers of 
porcelain in his face.
He indicates the grotesque blotch of purple on the death mask.
CRUVERE (CONT'D)
Also, his testicles were clawed and 
severely bruised, probably no more 
than five minutes before death.
The detectives take in the gory information.
CLOVIS
Nobody gets access to any lab reports 
but me.
Cruvere nods.

Eve pads through the house on bare feet, wearing only a bra 
and a soft cotton skirt. The PHONE RINGS. She ignores it.

He lies on the couch, blowing streams of demonic smoke to the 
ceiling, replaying the last days over and over, then he makes 
up his mind; jumps up.
EXT. MUSTANG - DAY
Eduardo's on the highway heading east. *
EXT. GULF BUNGALOW - DAY
Eve steps out of the front door, party gown bundled in her 
arms. She walks out on to the hot, white sand. She drops the 
gown on the deserted beach, produces some lighter fluid and 
douses the shimmery fabric. Then she strikes a match and 
tosses it onto the gown. A ball of flame erupts. She stares at 
the burnt offering for a moment, then turns to the tranquil 
sea, unsure of what comes next.
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
Eduardo's Mustang moves along the Mississippi coast. *CRUVERE (cont'd)98."
"INT. CLOVIS' OFFICE - DAY
Hunsman shows Clovis a lab report.
HUNSMAN
The crime scene's been messed with 
by at least two different people.
CLOVIS
What else?
HUNSMAN
They found Eve Garon's pubic hairs 
mixed with her husband's. She was 
fucking him right before he was 
killed. They also found her 
fingerprints on fragments of the lamp

When did you know, Eve?
EVE
When did I know what?
EDUARDO *
That I was tailor made for you.
EVE
I don't know what that's supposed to 
mean.

You knew I'd fix it. You knew I was 
so in love with you I'd clean up your 
dirty work.99."

I didn't know anything, Eduardo. *

She reaches for him. He recoils; fights for composure.
EDUARDO *
What I really... I want to believe 
you fell in love with me first.
EVE
I am in love with you.
EDUARDO *
You don't have to say that now! I'm 
implicated! I tainted the scene and 
you'll walk. My career’s over!
EVE
Eduardo, please, lets run away. *
EDUARDO *
You made me part of your crime! I'm 
guilty!
EVE
It doesn't matter what you did. He 
deserved to die.
EDUARDO *
I have to know what happened. I have 
to know if he did something to set 
you off, or you just nailed him.
And she unloads!
EVE
He raped me! Alright?! He raped me 
and we fought and I smashed him in 
the face with a lamp. I didn't stop 
to look back I just ran.
EDUARDO *
You didn't just run. You dressed the 
whole thing up like the pictures you 
saw at my house!
EVE
What are you talking about?
Eduardo bitterly gnaws at his lip. *
EDUARDO *
Did you see my car parked in front of 
your house?100."
"EVE
Yes.
EDUARDO *
Why didn't you stop? Ask me to help 
you?
EVE
I don't know.
Eve reaches back into the fog, remembers.
EDUARDO *
If he raped you, anything you did was 
self-defense! Everybody knows that! 
But you dressed the house up knowing 
I'd panic and cover for you. Or are 
you trying to tell me that a psycho 
just happened to be watching your 
house, waiting for the right moment 
to kill your husband?
Eve is stunned. She stares at him, incredulous.
EVE
I thought you killed him.
Her words lance his brain. He snatches her wrist and drags her 
to his car!
EVE
What are you doing? Eduardo, what's *
going on?!
EDUARDO *
You're going down for it, Eve. You 
killed him and you're going down!

I didn't. I swear. Eduardo, please. *

Get in the car.

CLOVIS
I've got everything I need to nail 
Eve Garon on this murder. With a 
little luck, I can nail Castro too. *

Come on, Bob. He tainted the scene

For christsake, Bob! You're not

Kroll leans right into Clovis' face.
CHIEF KROLL (CONT'D)
You can't nail him! Forget it! He

old road and stops at the camp.
Clovis yanks Eduardo out of the trunk. Clovis carries a duffle *
bag over one shoulder and a gun in the other hand. He pushes 
Eduardo over to a big open pavilion. It's a rough hewn post *

one side.
CLOVIS
I don't know how you got them 
pictures. But before the night's over 
you're gonna tell me everything.
He sits Eduardo against a post. *
CLOVIS
This place has got quite an 
interesting history.
EDUARDO *
Klan rallies or sodomite voodoo?
CLOVIS
Oh, all of the above. It was 
originally an Indian camp. When the 
Choctaws were being forced out they 
escaped to the bayou to seek refuge 
with the Chitimacha. But as you can 
imagine when one group moves in with 
another, trouble ensues.
EDUARDO *
I'm sure there were some nice 
soldiers who helped them figure it 
all out.

No doubt.
Clovis sets up a tripod and fits a rifle into it. He sights 
down the night scope.

Clovis begins laying out some torture weapons: a couple of 
knives, a saw, a pair of pliers. He pulls some gloves over his 
hands.

begins pouring blood.
CLOVIS
Your second problem is how you came 
by this interesting photo collection.
He pulls a stack of photos out of the duffle.
EDUARDO *
Stole them from your office.
CLOVIS
That's not gonna fly.
He punches Eduardo in the face again. *110."
"EDUARDO *
How the hell did you think you were 
gonna keep two other murders secret?
CLOVIS
Boy, you think you're gonna save 
yourself by throwing riddles at me?
Clovis tosses the photo of him and Dewayne at the camp in 
Eduardo's lap. *
CLOVIS
Who took this photo?
EDUARDO *
I don't know.
Clovis yanks Eduardo buy the collar and punches his face. *
Eduardo spits a tooth. *
CLOVIS
How'd you get it?
EDUARDO *
Somebody put it in my mailbox.
CLOVIS
Oh, it was junk mail, huh?
Clovis takes the pliers and RIPS OFF EVERETT'S PINKIE. EDUARDO *
SCREAMS and rolls over in agony.
CLOVIS
You think I'm gonna buy these games?
Eduardo gulps for enough air to quell the pain, his brain *
reeling. A sick realization bubbles up.
EDUARDO *
You really never saw those photos 
before?
CLOVIS
Oh, I look like I'm in on the joke?
Clovis grabs another of Eduardo's fingers, is about to snip it *
off when THE SOUND OF A MECHANICAL CLICK STOPS HIM. He 
stiffens. Picks up his gun. ANOTHER CLICK. IT'S A CAMERA!
Clovis jerks Eduardo to his feet and pushes him along. They *
come to the back of the pavilion. There is a doorway. Clovis 
pushes Eduardo through the doorway and they find themselves *
in:111."
"AN OUTDOOR KITCHEN AREA
Great cooking spits encircle the central work area. There are 
open beams above that let in the moonlight.
Clovis and Eduardo stare in wide eyed shock at -- *
MONTAGUE WALLACE
Hangs naked from a meat hook, illuminated by moonlight. Blood 
draining from his main arteries into a bucket below him. THE 
FAINT SOUND OF GURGLING BREATH BUBBLES FROM HIS MOUTH.
Eduardo stares, awestruck. *
INTERNAL VOICE
Who's mad at daddy?
A side door swings open. CLOVIS EMPTIES HIS GUN INTO THE BLACK 
DOORWAY. A body pitches forward. DEAD. IT'S DETECTIVE HUNSMAN - 
hands and mouth duck taped!
GILBERT
(o.s.)
Chubby turds sometimes move quicker 
than the boss man, huh Bob?
Clovis spins round with his gun and is shot through the 
clavicle. He drops straight back - eyes glazed in shock.
Gilbert appears from out of the shadows. Eduardo stares in *
horror.
GILBERT
You've gotten old and slow, Captain 
Bob. And a little stupid. *
Gilbert walks over to Clovis, kicks his gun away.
GILBERT
You ever look at any of my records? 
You'd have seen I scored higher than 
you in every category of police work, 
from tactics to marksmanship.
Gilbert turns and finds his eyes held by Eduardo's bewildered *
stare.
GILBERT
Everyday he looked right through me. 
Like I wasn't there. Do you know what 
it's like to be nonexistent in the 
eyes of others?
(to Clovis)
Do you see me now, Bob?112."
"Clovis grimaces and tries to muster his strength. Gilbert *
turns back to Eduardo. *
GILBERT
It's a cold world that leaves most of 
us on the outside. Watching. Looking 
and wanting. Looking and wanting. 
That's how we met, Eduardo. Two *
outsiders, looking and wanting. You 
remember?
Eduardo nods, once. *
GILBERT
You look and you want and you hate 
because you can't have. And you 
think, why can't I have? Who decided 
I can't have?
EDUARDO *
Gil, what's going on?
GILBERT
You haven't figured this out, 
Eduardo? Captain Bob's the janitor, *
who cleans up any mess that might 
embarrass the Fondling Fathers. He 
didn't kill any big shots. He just 
killed their little boy toys. With 
the help of his dog.
He gestures toward the lifeless Hunsman.
EDUARDO *
You took those photos?
Gilbert nods gently.
EDUARDO *
Gilbert, I don't understand.
GILBERT
This is a straight up tale of 
vengeance, Eduardo. Just like in *
Psalm 58:10. ""The righteous will 
bathe their feet in the blood of the 
wicked.""
EDUARDO *
Are you the righteous?
Eduardo's eyes search Gilbert's. *
GILBERT
Only compared with these two.
Gilbert turns to Wallace, clinging to his last breaths.113."
"GILBERT
Monty was the good old boy who 
destroyed my father. Fundator Abbas, 
huh, you old motherfucker?
EDUARDO *
Your father? What happened to your 
father, Gilbert?
Gil is transported to tragic memory. He turns his pained face 
to Eduardo. *
GILBERT
I found him, Eduardo. I came home *
from school and found him on the 
kitchen floor.
EVERETT’S VOICE
(v.o.)
The angle of the gunshot is like 
suicide.
FLASHBACK TO:
A CHILD’S KNEES ON THE BLOODY FLOOR
A dead father stares into the abyss, gun clenched in his fist, 
while a ten-year old’s hands wipe at the blood.
GILBERT'S VOICE
He had burn marks all over.
BACK TO:
EDUARDO AND GILBERT *
Gilbert's face shaken as he remembers.
GILBERT
He believed all the lies, Eduardo. *
That he'd get to be part of their 
club. A man to be respected. They 
brought him out here and just took 
him apart. For the fun of it.
Gilbert's face trembles bitterly.
GILBERT
And these pieces of shit went about 
happily devouring all the other 
daddies who tried to be like them.
Gilbert gives Wallace's body a little swing. The dying man can 
offer no resistance.114."
"Gilbert glances over at the struggling Clovis.
GILBERT
Oh, that little shot didn't do 
nothing but cause pain. You ain't 
bleeding out.
Clovis groans and tries to prop himself up.
GILBERT
If you were as tough as you claim 
you'd make some kind of move.
Clovis rolls over and begins crawling for the doorway.
GILBERT
(coaxing)
That's it, Captain Bob. I'll give you 
a head start.
A last hissing groan escapes Montague Wallace and he gives up 
the ghost. Gilbert turns to him.
GILBERT
I was hoping he'd last longer. Old 
shitheel.
Clovis suddenly springs to his feet and bursts into the woods. 
Gilbert goes after him.
Eduardo follows. *
EDUARDO *
Gil!  No! Don't!
Eduardo sees them run out of the pavilion into the swamp. He *
runs behind, hands still cuffed behind his back.
INTO CALVARIA WOOD
Clovis runs for all he's worth. Life preserving adrenaline 
fueling his body --
Gilbert chases, relentless --
Clovis picks his way through the woods and swamp.
Eduardo staggers after them. *
EDUARDO *
Gilbert!
CLOVIS runs harder, can feel himself gaining strength. His 
speed picks up --
But Gilbert pursues like a hellhound with the scent of blood --115."
"Eduardo stumbles behind them. *
Clovis runs through a stand of cottonwoods. He's getting away.
Gilbert stops; sets himself. Finds Clovis's path and aims --
He fires --
The bullet catches Clovis in the side of the face -- His eyes 
bulge in shock, feet instinctively churn forward, not knowing 
that he's already dead - reaching for an unseen handhold  --
Eduardo runs on to a rotted footbridge. He sees -- *
Clovis blindly tripping forward, eyes crazy, he tumbles like a 
fallen elk.
Eduardo loses his footing and falls through the crumbling *
slats on the footbridge. He hits the water and sinks. It's 
deeper than it looks -- EDUARDO CHURNS HIS FEET MADLY TO STAY *
AFLOAT, BUT THE THICK REEDS WRAP HIS LEGS and he struggles to 
keep his face above water.
EDUARDO FIGHTS; GOES UNDER. -- *
THEN: THROUGH THE WATER, HE CAN SEE GILBERT CROUCHED ABOVE HIM 
ON THE BRIDGE STARING DOWN.
Gilbert's hand comes at him -- 
Eduardo's eyes widen with fear -- *
Gilbert yanks him out of the water and drags him up on to the 
dock.
Eduardo gasps like a harpooned fish. Gilbert takes out a knife *
and cuts away the plastic cuffs.
Then, Gilbert tears a piece off his shirt and carefully wraps 
Eduardo's wounded hand. *
GILBERT
I did what I had to do. I won't try 
to justify it. But I don't mean you 
no harm.
Eduardo doesn't know how to respond. He waits. *
EDUARDO *
Gilbert, did you kill David Garon, 
too?
GILBERT
Yeah.
EDUARDO *
Why did you leave the mess?116."
"GILBERT
A test.
Eduardo doesn't get it. *
GILBERT
I wanted to see if you'd stick by 
her.
Eduardo's poleaxed. Indicted. *
EDUARDO *
I failed.
GILBERT
We all do, eventually.
Eduardo can't bear the burden of his misdeeds. *
EDUARDO *
Why did you use me, Gilbert?
GILBERT
I never used you, partner. I helped 
you solve the case. You're gonna be a 
star.
He passes his gun to Eduardo. *
GILBERT
You can do what you want with this. 
I'm done.
EDUARDO *
What do you expect me to do?
GILBERT
It's your call.
EDUARDO *
My call?
GILBERT
All the evidence lays out on Clovis. 
He's right there. If you want me, 
just pull the trigger. Either way, 
you're a hero, my friend.
Gilbert starts to walk away.
EDUARDO *
Gilbert! Stop!
Gilbert hesitates. But he doesn't stop.
Eduardo raises the gun. *117."
"EDUARDO *
Gilbert! Stop! Stop!
Eduardo steps toward Gilbert. *
EDUARDO *
Gilbert! I'll shoot!
Gilbert keeps walking.
EDUARDO FIRES A WARNING SHOT! *
THE BULLET BUZZES PAST GILBERT'S HEAD!
But still he doesn't stop.
Eduardo steadies the weapon, sights the kill shot. Follows *
Gilbert's path. Finger flexes. Hesitation.
Gilbert disappears into the black mist.
And Eduardo can only lower his gun. *
He can't kill his friend.
DISSOLVE TO:
THE GULF COAST - DAWN
A Mustang winds with the coastal highway as the first light of 
morning peers out on empty beaches and tidal marshes of 
needlerush and cordgrass. Eduardo drives. And drives. *
EVE'S VOICE
Two days ago you were the worst man 
I'd ever seen.
Eduardo pulls off the highway and settles his car in the soft *
sand near Eve's tiny beach house. He sits and waits. Lights a 
cigarette and watches --
EVE'S BUNGALOW
Quiet. A light is on in the kitchen. The sun breaks free and 
spills over the shore.
EVE'S VOICE
The sun rises and sets a couple of 
times and here you are.
EDUARDO WAITS AND WATCHES *
Sits on the hood of his car letting the day rise.118."
"Eventually, Eve emerges carrying a bucket of paint and 
utensils. She sets up at her fence and begins scraping old 
paint from the weathered wood.
Eduardo stubs out his tenth cigarette and goes over. Stands a *
discreet distance from the woman. She can feel him watching, 
but she doesn't stop working. The only sound comes from the 
waves breaking on the shore and the scraping of paint.
EVE'S VOICE
Every day is a fresh chance.
Eduardo picks up a wire brush, drops to his knees and begins *
scouring the peeling slats. They work together in silence.
                        THE END119."
