"	1	Gji      Hi all, When I was asked for the script of ANDHADHUN, I wondered which version makes the most sense. Because we had so many.  ANDHADHUN took it’s basic inspiration from the French short film, Le Accordeur.  That film ends on a solid tense situation but somehow I found it very funny. That was the nucleus. A blind man playing the piano as a man and woman dispose of a dead body in dumb charades. We had to construct a back story and a forward story from this madcap situation.   We have dozens of versions of the story and script. Some abandoned halfway, coz they were leading nowhere. Some so typical that we rejected them outright. In one version, Akash was a music teacher in a Pune school and had no lofty artistic aspirations. In another, Sophie and Pramod’s daughter merged into one character. In a third, a blind Akash enlisted the building kid’s help, to PRETEND he could see. The blind rabbit came into existence after three or four drafts. Once we were stuck on a scene and couldn’t crack it. By chance, an actor who had come for an audition told us a story that cracked our scene. I always wonder, what if he hadn’t come that day. We brainstormed a lot, that’s one of the main advantages of collaborative writing. We also argued and fought a lot.  What you read below is an in between draft. Somethings will be in full detail….and some just broad strokes.   All writing is rewriting….! We began ‘writing’ sometime in 2013….and we finished the last rewrite in July 2018. We were in Poland and kept reworking on the last scene between Akash and Sophie. Funnily, the last shot in the film was also the last shot on the last day of the film’s shoot.

We are in a vegetable patch in a field… besides a desolate road, leading to a distant highway.   And now we see a pair of feet cautiously moving forward thru the field. It’s an angry farmer with a rifle…..   The hare’s ears perk up as the farmer quietly advances thru the bushes and shrubs. The hare darts across the field, tensing up. And now we see the hare in close up. It’s got nasty scars where the eyes should be… We now realize the hare is blind.   The farmer cocks his gun and aims at the hare.  The blind hare senses danger…. It dashes blindly in the opposite direction, hitting the scarecrow pole full force…The scarecrow shakes a bit and stops.  The hare recovers… frozen for a second. The farmer advances stealthily. The farmer steps on a dry bisleri bottle in the field.   THE SOUND alerts the hare.  It hops on the road….Stands at a milestone, on its hind legs, ears upright….alert…  The farmer gets a clear view. The farmer sucks his breath and aims the rifle….  We see the blind hare in the cross hairs, resting against the milestone. The milestone reads PUNE 32 km though we are too coiled to read it.  The farmer squeezes the trigger.  finger on the trigger. On the SOUND OF THE GUNSHOT, we cut to BLACK. On black we hear the screech of a car. A shattering noise and after a beat, an EXPLOSION.  "

The notes of a piano fill the air as we see a tree lined lane in the Prabhat Road area of Pune.  A two storied building with a board saying LADY BARVE TRUST FOR THE DISABLED.  Inside a modest old flat we see a young man 27, playing the piano with total focus and concentration. We see a cat on a chair listening… It reminds us of an EDWARD HOPPER painting. It’s a digital piano on which there’s a picture of Kishore Kumar at some recording.  This is AKASH, a passionate piano player… his fingers dance on the keys… and now we see his eyes… they are glazed. We realize he is blind. The blindness does not seem to affect his passionate play.  And then he abruptly stops. And tries the last bit again. And Again. Stops. We sense he is stuck. He checks his braille watch and rises from the piano seat  EXT. ONE BHK FLAT. DAY.  "

Akash trips… and has a near nasty fall. The kid watches amused, as he untangles his leg and proceeds towards the gate.  The kid is KERSI… son of the Istree walla who lives behind the house.  ‘Hey, I can drop you to the bus stop…for five bucks’.  Akash turns and smiles. “Ah Kersi….thank you so much. Deal.’  He extends his hand and Kersi grabs it. And WINCES… AAOOOUUUCHH… AKASH IS SQUEEZING HIS FINGERS…. The next time you tie a rope na…remember this handshake…Now the sooner you call out an auto for me….”  Kersi screams at a passing auto.    INT. AUTO. DAY.  The auto is winding thru a busy road. Akash takes off his glasses and wipes the sweat on his nose. The driver notices his foggy eyes… Akash: Take it from the left…..near the school…. Driver: That’s a long cut Sir…. Akash: It’s ok….and slow down near the school gate…. The driver stops near the gate. WE SEE inside, the girls of the school are doing a lezim dance.  Akash is enjoying the music and energy….

Pull out and we see it’s the same actor, only 30 or more years later.   THIS IS PRAMOD SINHA, yes, the 70s star- famous for his bold films, family dramas, and the first start to work in a horror film too.  He is now retired and living in Pune. He is a flamboyant man, with a youthful spring in his stride.  He reads the comments below the song.  ‘Purani yaadein taaza kar di….Where are you, Pramod Kumar.’  He presses a like on a comment. In the bg we get a glimpse of his wife, emerging from her bath perhaps.  This is SIMI. She’s beautiful and much much younger. She seems like a fun person…..  "

So I put the crustacean in the deep freeze for about two hours. And then…..when he is  in deep sleep I simply take him out and put him in boiling water.   The frozen crab is immersed in boiling water.   Simi: …They say that crab meat is an aphrodisiac. I can’t spell the word but we all know what it means….

Akash is playing his piece…..And then he stops.  The assembled crowd claps.  Akash: It’s a fantastic piano… and if you must sell it, don’t sell it for less than ten…. Franco: Hey, Alurkar …you said the max I could get was 3.  Alurkar: Hey Akash….I only said there was an offer of 3…. Franco: … What do you do in the evening my boy?

Akash: thank you everybody….. 1 He introduces the piece he is going to play. AKASH PLAYING… There is something spiritual that happens when a talented musician plays, not for commerce, but for his own sake… from his or her heart, for the sheer joy of the process.  That’s what should happen when we watch Akash’s dexterous fingers… dancing on the keys……does he have two fingers or twenty…Akash is playing with sheer abandon. An acoustic piano and a Steinway to boot. He is in heaven.  And for that brief while so are we …… soon every conversation around the bar stops…. everyone is listening.  Akash concludes. And Pramod starts clapping. The others join too. THE CLAPS ARE NOW THUNDEROUS. Sophie is floored. Rushes to Akash but Pramod Sinha is already there.  Pramod: Behtareen Fantastic Mindblowing!

What if instead of bird shit, a coconut had dropped on your head? And you died on the spot? Or better still, the coconut hit the same optic nerve on your head and suddenly when you woke up you could see again…. Call it Kismat or Manmohan Desai, I know but it’s these things happen.

Akash exits lift.  There are two doors. One says PRAMOD ….Akash is playing blind of course. Goes to Pramod door. Rings bell. Akash rings bell again. No response. He looks around and rings bell again, this time longer. SUDDENLY……  EXT + INT. PRAMOD SINHA’S HOUSE. DAY. The door opens. WE SEE SIMI looking annoyed and angry. Yes?? Akash says he’s here for Mr. Pramod Sinha…  Simi is puzzled. Says her husband is not home.  Akash says but I WAS TOLD TO COME HERE AT 1.30 PM… She insists that he has gone to Bengaluru and will be back tomo morning. Akash:(surprised) But he called me today… I am the piano player at Franco’s. He said it’s his wedding anniversary and…  "

SUDDENLY…THE OPPOSITE HOUSE DOOR OPENS AND AN OLD LADY PEERS OUT…SHE STARES CURIOUSLY….AS AKASH SPEAKS. “he said he wanted to give you a surprise… he paid me an advance… can you please call him… The opposite door opens… and an old lady MRS. D’SA peeps out. Akash hears the sound.  “Shayad aa gaye….?” Simi asks Akash to come in…. She shuts the door and leads Akash in. She sits him at the piano and CALLS PRAMOD ON HER PHONE.  Hello PAMMI… there is this YOUNG MAN….what? Oh darling… WHAT A SURPRISE! this is so lovely….idiot why didn’t you tell me…come soon come soon…. Pls come … God I am not even dressed for the occasion…  “My husband is on the way….he is coming in ten minutes.

Akash tells her the story of the cricket ball and optic nerve damage. She says why don’t you play something…? Akash plays a few keys…and then suddenly… he sees A PAIR OF FEET STICKING OUT OF A FAR CORNER OF THE ROOM… THERE IS A POOL OF BLOOD AT THE FEET.  AKASH SKIPS A BEAT AND STOPS PLAYING. SIMI CLAPS.

TO ‘SEE’ A BAREBODIED STUD (mid 30s well-built) WITH A BUSHY MOUSTACHE… standing behind the shower curtain… a GUN IN HIS HAND. He stares at AKASH menacingly as Akash UNZIPS HIS PANTS AND TRIES TO PEE. THE MAN CONTINUES STARING AS AKASH ZIPS HIS PANTS AND GETS OUT….    • SIMI LEADS AKASH TO THE PIANO… AND NOW HE SEES THE DEAD MAN. IT IS PRAMOD SINHA. HE’S BEEN SHOT IN THE NECK. She seats Akash at piano… asks him to play some music. SHE INSTRUCTS THE MAN FROM THE BATHROOM IN DUMBCHARADES…TO FETCH SOMETHING FROM INSIDE. THE MAN returns with towels and a bucket. HIS NAME IS MANOHAR.   • Akash playing the piano AND PROVIDING background music as he watches: MANOHAR AND SIMI SWIFTLY CLEAN UP THE AREA….They  SHOVE PRAMOD SINHA’S BODY INTO the  SUITCASE. Simi stops and removes the ROLEX watch from Pramod’s wrist. She shoves it in a drawer. Akash watching all this thru his dark glasses He CONTINUES PLAYING AS …… Simi and Manohar confer.   • SIMI FURIOUSLY cleans the floor of glass pieces and Manohar drags the body across to an inside room.   • Akash playing…..barely looking up. Simi has now come to the piano….. Akash plays like a blind man playing for his life.   • Simi moves to the passage as Manohar wheels in a suitcase…..Once again, they discuss something…and Manohar OPENS THE SUITCASE AND PULLS OUT A HAND.  Simi quickly removes Pramod Sinha’s watch but the ring proves to be stubborn.   • Manohar snaps the finger and pulls out the ring. Akash watches Simi wince……..  "
"	27	• Simi runs in again and fetches Pramod’s beige jacket and cap. She also brings the BLUE TOOTH speaker, which we have seen a couple of times. We are trying to figure out what she’s up to…   • Manohar watches Akash who is STILL playing… Simi does something with Pramod’s phone. (she’s syncing the phone to the BLUE TOOTH SPEAKER … and gestures Manohar IN DUMBCHARADAS TO GO TO THE DOOR AND RING THE BELL….MANOHAR, A BIT PUZZLED OBEYS.   • THE BELL RINGS. And Simi springs to the door…ah I think Pramod is back…..Simi ushers MANOHAR to continue the clean up  as Simi talks: Arre, Pammi such a lovely surprise….Oooh….he plays so well… AKASH PLAYS  SOME SOLID ROMANTIC TUNE AS MANOHAR puts on Sinha’s jacket and stare  STUPIFIED.   • Akash nearing the end of the piece. Simi is ready. She signals Manohar to clap AND WE HEAR PRAMOD’S VOICE. Wah Wah Bahut Achhe Behtereen… Wah (THE HOME VIDEO OF SIMI AND PRAMOD ON A HAPPIER DAY) We realize she is using Pramod Sinha’s recorded voice to construct a conversation with him.  • Akash watches Simi escort ‘PRAMOD’ to the inside room. He waits... like Manohar waits…both staring at each other…IN THE BACKGROUND….we hear  SIMI ARGUING with ‘Pramod’. We mostly hear Simi speak… What… the builder is waiting for you? Why now? Cant it wait? Oh Pramod….…come back soon….this boy is waiting.   • SIMI GESTURES MANOHAR TO LEAVE… Manohar wheels out the suitcase.  EXITS.   • SIMI: “Would you like a juice Akash? No, thank you, ma’am. Simi watches SINHA’S CAR DRIVE OUT OF THE BUILDING. WE SEE HER GO TO A PHOTO OF PRAMOD…maybe she’s a bit overwhelmed…. SHE SITS ON A SOFA. SHE BREAKSDOWN FOR REAL….THOUGH SHE HAS TO ENSURE THAT THE BLIND MAN DOESN’T HEAR HER.   • We see Akash playing the piano….in the distance she’s crying.  THE PHONE RINGS... a call from Manohar. She talks like she’s speaking to Pramod. “……haan Pramod….where are you? Oh dear. Ok…I’ll see you there… She turns to Akash…..Sorry. Today’s session is cancelled. "

We introduce SUB INSPECTOR KAMDAR Yes?  Akash says I want to report a crime/murder I want to meet the SHO.   Kamdar stares curiously at him and leads him inside. Makes him sit.  ‘SAAB TOILET MEIN HAIN.’  We hear the flush and the door opens and THE CHIEF INSPECTOR STEPS OUT.   IT’S MANOHAR IN UNIFORM.  BOTH AKASH AND MANOHAR DO A DOUBLE TAKE.  KAMDAR says… he wants to report a murder….  AKASH almost drops a glass of water…SAYS ….my CAT …. IT’S MISSING. MAYBE MURDERED. There is a boy in the building….Kesari….i suspect he killed it.   Akash makes a bit of a fool of himself but Manohar is extremely suspicious...   EXT. POLICE STATION. DAY.  As Manohar puts Akash in his car / jeep and is to drive off. A car comes to a screeching halt on the other side of the road and a fuming lady comes out and accosts Manohar.   
	29	WE realize it’s his wife RASIKA… and Manohar has stood her up for a lunch date……And he’s not answering her calls too.  Akash sits quiet…wondering how he can make Manohar believe his cat missing story….  Rasika is a dominating virago...and she charges into Manohar from the side of his car through the window.   Manohar somehow mumbles that he is on an important case and promises dinner and escapes...  As Manohar drives off Rasika thunders at the police guard who was watching the fracas.....the guard quickly looks away.    MANOHAR at AKASH’S BUILDING.   He examines Akash’s house. Looking around suspiciously.   Poking his head in the bathroom...strumming the piano… Opening drawers etc…. Akash watching…   Manohar spots a hammer in a kitchen drawer. Manohar SUDDENLY leaps over a teepoy and makes a move as if to attack Akash with hammer.  AKASH is scared but prepared. DOESN’T FLINCH.   Can I see your eyes…PULLS OUT AKASH’S GOGS. Akash is prepared. Manohar stares at his vacant eyes. We hear a school bus. Akash says that’s the kid’s school bus. Grill him about the cat sir….MANOHAR IS CONVINCED THIS BOY IS BLIND. AND THEN HE SEES THE CAT coming in thru window. Meeow. Akash grabs the cat… thank you… Sir…      EXT. INT. FRANCO’S NIGHT.   A car stops and we see Simi get out. She’s LOOKING STUNNING.  Simi enters and announces to FONSECA and SOPHIE that it’s her anniversary and Pramod will be coming any minute.

Pramod Sinha enters his house, laden with a bouquet and a bottle of wine and many other presents.  He is on tip toe…as he searches for Simi in different rooms.  And then, he hears a sound in the kitchen. Ah. That’s where she is.  He moves towards the kitchen when he notices a GUN on the table…. Curious he picks it up and stares as the kitchen door opens….  SIMI steps out adjusting her slip as Pramod says SURPRISE!  AND then he sees MANOHAR ON THE DINING TABLE… rising and wearing his pants.  THE CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE CRASHES ON FLOOR… Pramod grabs Manohar’s gun resting on his jeans and TRIES TO FIRE… AS Simi and Manohar struggle with Pramod. AND THEN PRAMOD FALLS… THEY STARE AT HIS BLEEDING BODY AS THE DOORBELL RINGS… SIMI LOOKS AT THE DOOR. WE SEE THE ‘IMAGINED’ MURDER SEQUENCE which may well be how it happened.   INT. FRANCOS. NIGHT.

Maybe searching them for more currency notes.  Police cars are all over. Some journalists lurk in the background... A stretches carries away a white sheet covered body to an ambulance.

Kamdar: (in Marathi) There were some five hundred and two thousand rupees lying around....may be the killers were in a hurry so they did not have time to pick these up....all are being investigated...   Reporter: .....It's really sad that such a senior actor who ruled Bollywood once will meet his end this way....as per his  wife...he  was lately investing in some real estate deals and went out carrying around One Crore in cash.....while  we feel sad and ask the police to look into this more sharply…we also must comment here that such cash transaction in real estate still shows the government's claim of removing cash transaction is only a claim.....

A girl is sitting next to Simi facing Kamdar…sobbing intermittently... we may not have a clear view of her in the first shot...but that's ok.   The ROLEX watch is lying inside a plastic cover with a number pasted on it.   Manohar: (rolls down his sleeves as he looks at Kamdar and Simi…who turns to see him) They will sing....matter of time.

He pulls out his phone and calls Sophie.  Akash:  Hi…I need to talk to you. How soon can you come home. You come I’ll tell you but come soon. As he is talking, Akash pulls out milk from the fridge… puts water on the gas and loads two heapfuls of BRU FILTER COFFEE into the small steel filter. As the water boils, he cracks a boiled egg for the cat. (HIS KITCHEN PROPS MUST BE BLIND FRIENDLY)  Akash does NOT notice, the phone camera hovering about his kitchen window. The Bell rings. Akash rushes to door….sees the dark gogs…. debates… and he wears it. IN BG WE SEE THE SELFIE STICK GO DOWN….   Akash opens the door. It’s SIMI. He can see her! She looks a little tense and upset.

She’s not there.  WE GET A START. SIMI IN A SCREAM MASK STANDING JUST NEXT TO HIM. (A reveal shot, like the Bhoot in BHOOT)   But Akash DOES NOT FLINCH. Al Pacino would have been proud of his performance.  He slowly finds his way to the table. Calls out to Simi, like a blind person would. SIMI REMOVES THE MASK and sits in front of him  Akash: Shakkar …Doodh…? Simi: black. Thank you. He puts some sugar in his mug….   Simi waits for some time, THEN DELVES INTO HER BAG and brings a bottle marked POISON and puts three drops in Akash's cup. Waits... She puts a few more drops and very business-like puts the bottle back on the table.  SIMI STARES AT HIM….  "
"	43	‘Thandi ho gayi hai….pee lo’ AKASH STIRS HIS CUP. She watches him.  Stalemate. They both wait......'staring' at each other.....Akash shakily picks up the cup...    “Main Rusk leke aata hoon….” He rises, fumbles and drops the coffee......   She dips into the bag...extracts a gun with one hand and jumps up.  Simi: That does it...../Bahut ho gaya naatak/ Pata tha tum yehi karoge/   She cocks the gun....as she  thrusts it on Akash's face. Akash raises his hand....Simi laughs viciously..bitterly...helplessly....   Simi: Utaro Chasma! Do you need the glasses any more you rascal??   Akash takes off the glasses and stares at Simi...  Akash: Hi.   Simi: Mr. Fake Blind.....meet Fake gun......(she fires phut phut phut ..the stunt gun just clicks...she drops the gun...sits back and laughs bitterly)..  Akash: I...I am sorry.....aapko mujhe ghar ke andar allow nahin karna chahiya tha/ Aapne mujhe andar kyoon bulaya? Bahar se si bhej deti…Aapne  mujhe ghar ke andar aane kyoon diya……/Us din aap ne mujhe andar aane ke liye kyoon kaha? you should have never let me in....   Simi: Mujhe kya maloom tha ki tum andhe nahin ho/ Andha samajhke allow kiya. Bahar wo Mrs D’sa sab sun rahi thi… WHAT A BLOODY MESS!  tum yeh drama kyon kar rahe ho..  Akash:  Shuru mein riyaaz tha…phir ek din mein Sophie se mila aur…   Simi: Sophie jaanti hai? Akash: Koi nahin jaanta.

"	44	Manohar is just a good…..    Pammi mujhe surprise dena chahte the….kisko mila surprise…...?? Timing… bad timing….!!? KYA HUA?  Akash is feeling all woozy suddenly. He tries to stand and falls… ….SOMETHING IS WRONG.   He looks up to see SIMI STARE AT HIM. SHE’S WAITING….. His eyes go on the box of pedas.   Akash: Kya tha us pede mein….? Kya daala tumne us pede mein….   SHE STARTS SHUTTING THE WINDOWS…..AS AKASH RUSHES TO BASIN…….TRYING TO GAG…PUKE      Akash at the basin desperately trying to puke….and he COLLAPSES…..  SIMI WHIPS OUT HER PHONE. CALLS MANOHAR….NO REPLY. She tries again…..the phone is ringing….  And suddenly the piano starts playing. Simi turns WITH A SHUDDER…to see THE CAT ON THE PIANO STARING AT HER.   INTERVAL    PRABHAT ROAD EXT. DAY. Violent shots of a sharp knife slicing flesh. It’s a coconut vendor dexterously slicing a coconut. Sophie is waiting, another coconut in her hand.  Cut to  EXT. AKASH’S HOUSE. DAY.  SOPHIE WALKING TO AKASH’S DOOR balancing TWO COCONUTS.   "
"	45	AT THE STAIRS. Kersi accosts Sophie.  Kersi: Didi…..ek video dikhana hai….breaking news….sirf 50 Rupaye…. Sophie shoos the kid off but Kersi insists. Kersi: Achha video dekho phir paise do…. SEE!  SOPHIE LOOKS AT THE CLIP ON HIS PHONE. IT’S AKASH in the kitchen… without glasses…..HIS EYES WIDE OPEN.  SOPHIE STARES AT THE CLIP IN A LOOP…FUCK. Akash is sighted?  ‘Give me 50 bucks says Kersi as Sophie shoos him and strides up the stairs BEWILDERED to say the least.  Akash can see?  SHE RINGS THE BELL…There’s no response. She rings bell again. No response.  AND THEN WE HEAR THE BOLT.    The door opens to reveal SIMI. She has a sheet wrapped around her shoulder …. Simi looks like she’s just woken up.  Sophie, looks STUNNED.  She barges in to see Akash sprawled on a sofa/diwan… his clothes strewn about too. A half empty bottle of wine on the window sill….. Sophie calls out to Akash who is breathing heavily, like in a stupor… maybe he mumbles something.  Sophie turns to see Simi behind.   SOPHIE STARES AT SIMI….  Simi:    I am so embarrassed. Sorry…I am sorry…. Pramod ke death ke baad…. pata nahin…. and Akash …..was so kind…..understanding…..  SOPHIE: (INTERRUPTING) and sensitive and emotional and so wild in bed… Wow….. I’m glad I’m not the only one who swallowed the sob story about how he lost his eyes. 14 saal ki umar mein…..  SIMI: (feigns innocence) Kya? Akash andhaa nahin hai? Dekh sakta hai?  "

Aur ek message de de na….Franco’s ka piano bik gaya. His services are no longer required.   SOPHIE STORMS OUT OF THE ROOM, trying to control her tears.  OUTSIDE, KERSI ACCOSTS HER.  Kersi: Didi, Mere pachchas rupye?  Sophie gives him a tight slap…. She starts her bike and leaves…..Upstairs, at the window, we see Simi watching from behind curtain.  FADE OUT   INT.  AKASH’S HOUSE. NIGHT. We last saw Akash on the bed….He is still there….maybe a couple of hours have passed. Akash wakes up.  WE SEE HIS FACE. WE SLOWLY GO TO HIS EYES.  THEY OPEN. THEY ARE DAMAGED. IT’S AN UNSETTLING SIGHT. He, and we, wonder as………Akash keeps rubbing his eyes….and suddenly he gets up, We see him stumble, and flay his arms wildly…..  CUT TO: Akash dunking his head in a bucket of water. Repeatedly. He is kneeling in the bathroom over a red bucket….. Again we see his bloody DAMAGED eyes.  "
"	47	And then he hears discordant sounds of the piano.  He stumbles out. Simi is at the piano….she turns to see Akash at the doorway.  Akash: Mrs. Sinha….kya kiya tumne mere saath….mujhe kuch dikhayi nahin de raha….  Simi: Tum 14 ki umar se andhe ho na? Article bhi aaya tha paper mein…..  Akash GOES CRAZY.   Akash: Kya dala mere aankhon mein….Mujhe doctor ke paas le chalo….PLEASE…. Take me to a doctor NOW…. varna mein sab bol doonga….  Akash hears the clatter of his cane. And Simi speaks.  Simi: Jao doctor ke paas. Press mein bhi jao, police mein bhi jao, ek aur statement do… Simi Sinha ne Pramod Sinha ka murder kiya. Mujhe andha bhi bana diya. Ho sakta hai koi yakeen kar lega tumhara. Goodnight.  She heads to the door and turns.  Simi: Music pe dhyaan do…..artist ho na?  Akash hears the door shut.   EXT. AKASH’S HOUSE. NIGHT.  Simi walks out coolly…in the distance, Kersi is sitting and reading. Simi calls out to him.  Simi: Kya video hai tumhare phone mein….? She gives Kersi a 500 buck note. Kersi shows the clip.  Simi DELETES it.   "
"	48	Simi: Hey kahan hai clip….? Kersi snatches the phone to find the clip missing…. Kersi swiping his phone repeatedly….Simi snatches the 500 bucks back and leaves…   INT. FRANCO’S. NIGHT.  A tearful Sophie on the phone.  Sophie:  Don’t bother…. I saw it with my own eyes….The kid showed me the clip…you can see. SHUT UP AND LISTEN TO ME. You just broke my heart. Write a song about that you asshole. And IF YOU CALL ME AGAIN, I’LL EXPOSE YOU TO THE COPS.’ HANGS UP.  In the distance, Fonseca puts a few coins in the Tips Bowl. Unaware of everything….   INT. AKASH’S HOUSE. NIGHT.   Akash. Head bowed between legs. He’s crying.   ON AUDIO, WE HEAR A BARRAGE OF VOICES…INTERRUPTING EACH OTHER. (there can be flash-cut of faces too) Are you saying that all these days you were playing blind? So you saw Pramod Sinha leave with a lot of money. Oh you saw the murder and yet kept quiet about it.  Why did you give a false statement? Maybe you had an accomplice and you tipped him off about the money with Pramod What is Pramod Sinha’s wedding ring  doing in your flush tank? Akash is on the floor, imagining all scenarios.   "
"	49	EXT.  AKASH HOUSE. NIGHT.  We follow Kersi coming upstairs and peeping in thru the window. His pov: We see Akash crying. Kersi stares……a bit unsettled to see the crying man.  Akash: (hearing a sound) Kaun hai…who’s there… Kersi just backs off… scared…. Cut to:   EXT. LAL DEVAL. NIGHT.    Manohar is completely flabbergasted…they sit in a parked car and talk…  Manohar: What do you mean, you blinded him? How? Simi: There are a dozen ways on Google.   Manohar: How does blinding help?? Are you mad??? He can go to the press..I will be taken out of this investigation…and we will both be caught…..you should have killed him there….  Simi: Oh yeah... so I am the supari guy here….kill him..kill her..and I run?? am I to kill everybody when you not take my calls because you are with your bloody wife ??   Manohar: hey you also kept phones silent….you were married too…remember…  Simi: yeah…with a thousand times better person than what I got here… (turns and snaps) …and why did you bring the gun to my house… that day ?? If you had not got the gun, none of this would have happened. (mimics) A big macho man….must carry a gun…while somebody else does the dirty jobs ehh? (she covers her face with hand) fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck…..  Manohar stares at her….thinking…  INT.  AKASH HOUSE. LATE NIGHT  We hear some drawers being opened. "
	50	Akash gropes for a Tin box…..finally finds it.  HE REMOVES MONEY FROM THE BOX AND his passport. He stuffs them into his pocket. HE STUMBLES ON A COCONUT. He is flummoxed.  HE takes his passport and starts walking out of the room when a piece of cloth brushes his face. It’s a bedsheet…. hanging from the ceiling fan. And we realize it’s a make shift NOOSE. … and suddenly we glimpse MANOHAR in the shadows …..  Manohar grabs his neck and tightens the noose as Akash struggles to free himself and breathe…. SOLID STRUGGLE… Akash is flaying his free arm….like Grace Kelly in Dial M for Murder.  And Akash lays his hands on one of the Spray Cans that Simi had kept out. Akash gets a chance to spray Manohar’s face with Mortein’s HIT.  Or it can be an electric iron that comes into Akash’s hands and he whacks blindly with it and hits Manohar on the forehead. Manohar clutches his forehead and falls as Akash stumbles his way to a Wait until Dark escape.  EXT. LAW COLLEGE ROAD.   NIGHT. It’s an empty road with occasional speeding traffic. A couple of dogs bark furiously as we see…. Akash totter….stumble…..and finally holds on to a lamp post. He tries to stop a passing vehicle and then another but they just speed by…. Akash moves along the road….the sounds of dogs and distant music filling his ears.  
"	51	And suddenly out of the blue, a chicken van turns the corner and wings Akash……he falls on the ground.  The van speeds on….In the distance, an auto is approaching. The auto stops. CUT TO: A few seconds later….We see a BLEEDING MANOHAR ON THE ROAD, searching…. CUT TO:  EXT. INT. HIDEOUT.  DAY.  An isolated old building adjacent to a railway track. An express train thunders by….. A van is parked outside the building. Cut to: Inside. We are in a municipal clinic….or some such place though it looks defunct.  There is a vague hooded light…..shining into camera…. With a start…Akash sits up…he is immediately held by somebody…we see MURLI holding him….  Dr. Swami checks Akash…..as SAROJA, is watching. We recognize Saroja as the lady who runs the lottery stall on Karve Road. Swami taking away the torch from his eyes..Saroja watching… Akash: where am I..what is this?? Murli: I am MURLI sir..auto driver….taken you around a few times….you fainted on the road last night.. what happened?? Akash: Murli….(tries to remember)..where am I?? Swami: In good hands my boy…I am a doctor..they called me in the morning…this is my nursing home.  Swami comes and pats him on the back. "
"	52	Akash: (frantic) Doctor….pls….my eyes….there is something in my eyes… Doctor…it’s burning….It’s all dark….I can’t see anything….earlier I could see…a bit…light…now…. Swami: I see your eyes are swollen…also some bruises… Murli: He has been blind since age 14…. Swami: I’ve seen him play at Franco’s. Wonderful. When God takes something, he gives something else.  Akash: what is wrong with my eyes…. …. Swami: This looks like very recent damage…..Did you pour some wrong drops in your eyes by mistake…? Akash: No….I….can you tell me what is wrong? Doctor: I need to take you to an eye specialist. But right now, you need some food and rest. ……(to Saroja) give him these pills and tomorrow you should be fine.   Akash: Murli..was somebody..somebody chasing me last night…did you see anybody… Murli: No..why?? Akash falls silent…..Saroja comes forward…. Saroja: Is there anybody you would like us to inform….? You didn’t have a phone….Your passport and money was in your pocket. It’s safe…. Murli: This is my mausi sir….she sells lottery tickets… Saroja: ….should we call somebody…. Akash: No….I want to meet the specialist…. Swami: Rest today….let me give you a tetanus shot, for safety…(presses a wound) this looks nasty. Dr. Swami pulls out his doc bag and takes out a fresh syringe.  "
	53	Swami: (dabs spirit on his forearm) Steady…. Akash WINCES as the doc injects the syringe. We see him extract blood in the syringe. We wonder …..  HIDEOUT. DAY.   Some time has passed. Murli brings out Akash from a sideroom…looks to be a bathroom…  Saroja opens some packets of Poha and vada. on a table….Murli takes Akash to the table…he  sits. Saroja pours a thin tea for him…  Mausi: So where is your family….beta? Akash: My mother passed away….my father….is not in touch for many years…. Akash takes a sip of tea and rises……  Murli: careful…It’s a big room...let me help you…  He holds Akash and takes him out to a balcony….a train passes by… Akash: which place is it…  Murli: Loni station is only 10 minutes walking…  Another TRAIN passes and we TRAnsitIoN to:   EXT. INT. HIDEOUT. NIGHT.   We see the doctor drive towards the building in his OLD VAN. The doctor waves at Murli…..gesturing him to come down.  The doctor comes in… looks at Saroja and nods…Murli sees that and comes…..  Dr. Swami: It’s done…total 2 lakhs for you…but both kidneys….he hasn’t  eaten anything no ? Good..we can do it now….  
	54	Saroja nods...Murli is shocked…  Murli: Both kidneys??...But…but how will he live??  Swami: Don’t worry ….He won’t…….just take the body and put it on the track at night….who checks for missing kidneys in a run over case??? And he is blind…people will think he just wanted to cross….   Murli: Mausi…are…are you ok  with this??  Saroja: Were you ok when your mother begged in trains….ehh??  Swami: (to Murli) get the things ready….Aah….Akash…you are looking much better.   He walks towards Akash……we see Murli and Saroja contest a point ..we do not hear them..but Murli is losing… Swami: I have fixed with Dr. Ambike for tomorrow morning. Come on…lie down and let me give you a proper examination. SAYS SOMETHING FUNNY.  Swami motions to Saroja and Murli…to get the equipment and start the work…..  We see Murli and Mausi wheel in some equipment and stuff.  Dr. Swami’s mobile rings…he cuts…  Akash is relaxed as Swami leads him to to the centre of the room. Swami: take off your shirt and trouser…and lie on your stomach.  Akash takes them off…and is helped on the steel bed…  Akash: ohh…it’s cold..?? is it an OT bed?  Swami: (puts a rubber/plastic sheet below) Oh sorry….here…..Wear this….Yes….You are in my clinic….  Akash fleetingly wonders….clinic….with so much silences….no sign of other patients….. Swami pulls out a syringe…as Saroja comes and turns Akash over on his belly.. 
"	55	 In close up, we see Dr. Swami make an injection.  A SURREAL GIALLO atmosphere. The soundtrack is SERGIO.  Akash on his belly…..AROUND HIM Saroja is wearing a surgical mask and Murli puts scalpel and scissors and forceps  in boiling water.   The doctor wears his surgical gloves which makes their own chic chic sound. He is continuously chatting….putting the patient at ease….  Swami’s mobile rings again. He cuts it.   Dr. Swami prepares the anesthesia and signals instructions to Saroja. Murli is watching….trying to make his peace with the situation. Akash is blissfully unaware…..5 Dr. Swami: Relax….I’m going to give you an injection.  Dr. Swami’s mobile rings. Again. He frowns and looks up…  Swami picks it up in a fury and shouts…  Swami: now you also…YES..I cut the cable connection…ask LADDOO to study and it will be back…..and instead of seeing those stupid serials you can help him study….I am in the middle of an operation.. so don’t call for next one hour…  A BURST OF MUSIC.   He cuts the call….Akash tries to turn..  Akash: Hey..hey what operation is this??  What are you doing??? Murli..Mausi…hey…  Swami: Hold him….  Mausi holds the legs….Murli holds Akashs hands….  The doc quickly pushes the injection in……he drops the syringe…takes a pen and draws mark around two kidneys… 																																																								5	Have	a	doc	explain	the	process	and	equipment	required.

Doc rushes to help her…  Murli: Don’t fight..its just one kidney we will take…you will have another…..we are  poor people….we need money…please..don’t mind…yes??  Akash is slipping into darkness…  Akash: You are fools…I can give you much more….Mausi…listen to me….your Shivji tattoo ki kasam..don’t operate on me..I CAN GET YOU A CRORE…..listen to me….I AM YOUR BIGGEST LOTTERY.  Akash goes limp…..Swami rises..  Swami: huh..some stud….(he goes to Akash’s side and chuckles as he takes a  scalpel)…one crore….?? Ha…  Saroja is thinking..she  suddenly says…  Saroja: Wait…(doc stops) how did he know I have a  Shivji tattoo??   They stare at Akash who is unconscious.  SUITABLE TRANSITION to:  DREAM LIKE LOCATION. DAY. It’s a house with a terrace….or maybe a cottage in the woods.  It’s a bright summer morning and Sophie is making breakfast.  Eggs…sunny side up. SOPHIE IS BLINDFOLDED but she’s doing everything perfectly.  Akash is sighted. Reading the papers. Sipping Watermelon Juice. The headline says SIMI MISSING. The toast pops up.   Sophie places the eggs in front of Akash and starts buttering the crisp toast.   
	57	 Akash cuts out the yolks from the eggs….He places the yolks on a tissue… Sophie is fentaoing the coffee.   Akash walks out with the yolks. We hear birds. Crows.   And now we see Simi on the terrace…..she’s lying on the mosaic tiles…. her hands tied… her head between two solid bricks.   She looks at Akash and screams something though all we hear are the crows. The crows get louder and LOUDER as Akash places the egg yolks on her eyes…  One by one…… Simi screams and struggles but all we hear are crows and piano…. The crows descend on the egg yolks on Simi’s eyes….  TIGHT CLOSE UP OF BEAK ATTACKING YOLK.  Akash walks away to meet blindfolded Sophie with a piping hot cup of coffee. ‘here…have some coffee….’    ABRUPT CUT TO:  HIDEOUT: NIGHT. It’s a couple of hours later….  Saroja: wake up..  Akash sits up on bed…..tries to look and feel around…  Saroja finds his hand and puts the coffee cup in…  Saroja: coffee…drink some….  Akash desperately feels around his back…no incision…Saroja watches impassively…then she says…  Saroja: you are lucky lucky..the doctor was planning to take both kidneys…we would have got 2 lakhs. (she stops)..now what about this one crore…and how did you know I have a tattoo…  Akash digests the fact that he has barely survived..he drinks coffee…then he says…

You can also have a crystal tortoise ..or a  wooden wood chime for luck….  MANOHAR WALKS IN. HE HAS A NASTY CUT ON HIS FOREHEAD. He looks around the shop, pretending to inspect things.  Simi notices his grim face and the cut….  Simi: Why don’t I do one thing….take my card..give me a call.

Through the hole….the Buddha comes and falls on the bathroom floor….Manohar looks at it…  Outside a crying...hysterical Rasika aims the gun again….as she screams…  Rasika: That’s from her fucking shop…I know it….you come out ..you rat…... I will kill you…  Manohar: Rasika put down the gun…please..you will hurt yourself.. it’s all nonsense. please….I made a mistake… .I love you only….  Rasika: So you think she is more beautiful than me??  Manohar: Am I mad??? She is a lying bitch...a witch…I went mad…..(all quiet…only Rasika  sniffling outside…Manohar sneezes)..please…can I come out…give me the gun first…  Silence…..Manohar tiptoes down…  His mobile rings on the bathroom counter…. BLAM….another shot….Manohar leaps back..the towel falls…  Rasika: That’s her…that’s her…I know that’s her…  Manohar picks up….it’s Kamdar…  Manohar: It’s Kamdar….  Rasika: I don’t believe you…put it on speaker….  Manohar does…  Manohar: Hello….??  
	65	Kamdar: Sir….Simiji’s  car is found at the hillside sir….it seems she has jumped and committed suicide…  The door opens….naked Manohar comes out…gaping with the phone in hand….Rasika looks at him…    TV NEWS. VARIOUS LOCATIONS.     We see Simi’s car near the raging waters…. There is a crowd of onlookers….as divers are getting ready for a search…  On TV we see the police bandobast on the cliff side….Manohar and Kamdar…a  stunned Daani is comforted by a policewoman…   Anchor: Within a week of Pramod Sinha’s brutal murder…his wife Simi goes missing. Her car is found at the hillside…Police suspect she may have committed suicide out of grief….but there is no suicide note found…  We can move from anchor to anchor…  Manohar: (on TV) we are looking into this…that’s all I can say…..   INT. FRANCO’S. NIGHT    Manohar: (on TV) we are looking into this...that’s all I can say...  Daani: Mother left with my music teacher….  Anchor: Intrerestingly……Akash the blind music teacher is also not found at his place…  Sophie watches….she smirks..  Sophie: they have eloped.  Franco watching TV too….  Franco: you are too negative….give the boy a chance to explain.. 
	66	 Sophie: Do you know he lied to me??    INT. HIDEOUT. NIGHT.   As the anchor reads the news Simi is wheeled into the room…..  She is struggling…she finds her eyes are taped and her hands and feet are tied……..even her mouth is gagged….  Suddenly she falls very quiet as the news are read out….we  sees tears are trickling down from under her taped eyes… (we should feel sympathy at this  point)   Murli helps Akash to Simi’s chair (should be a bizarre sort of scene) ….  Akash feels Simi’s face.. Simi cringes … Under her gag Simi is sobbing …. She tries to move her hands  and legs…but much more feebly this time…Akash feels the eyes…gagged mouth...stops at tears…. Murli whispers to him..  Murli: she is crying…  Akash feels and then fumbles and opens the gag at the mouth…  Akash: Crying at the news of your own death….??  Simi  starts shouting….  Simi: Help….please help….  Akash holds his hand over her mouth…  Akash: listen to me….you cannot get away from here….I want to blind you and take your eyes..and the people who are helping me….they want to take your kidneys and sell that…..there is no escape till you do as you are told….  Akash calls out….  
	67	Akash:  Doctor….  Swami comes and puts in a syringe..extracts the blood…  Simi: (screams) what are you doing?? What is this….  Akash: I cannot see…cannot tell….possibly the doctor is taking some blood….some blood group needs to be matched.  Simi: You can’t be serious…..you cannot do this….Manohar will get you….  Akash: Oh I cannot do this….really?? and one person can go around killing and blinding people…..?? (he laughs) by the way ..Manohar thinks you are dead…and his wife knows about you now…so….guess he will not be so keen…  Simi: What...what do you want…  Saroja: One crore…  Simi: who…who was that?? How may are here…  Akash: you can count when we open your eyes….now…why not start with a confession.. tell us what happened….  Simi: (takes a breath…looks around) hey….why don’t you take this man and  sell his kidneys or whatever….I will pay you double for what you will  get if you let me go and take him instead…..is that a  deal??  There is an uneasy silence…then Dr. Swami speaks  Swami: that makes sense to me…  Simi: doesn’t it?? Open my eyes….i will pay triple if you let me watch as you cut this guy open….  Akash: She doesn’t even have ten lakhs she told me.  Simi: I lied…  
"	68	Murli: You lie, you kill your husband….that’s why I don’t like you…..  Saroja:  Imagine a bahu like this for you….  Simi: Who killed her husband…???  Akash: you did..I saw..you forgot i was there…you helped Manohar pack the body…  Simi: I just helped him… it was  an accident….Manaohar brought his gun…PRAMOD picked it up….they struggled ..the gun went off…  Akash: but that’s not what police know..do they?? May be you planned it with your lover…  Simi: I tell you it was an accident….Manohar  called me up to wish for the anniversary… ..heard I was alone so came over….only if stupid Pramod would not be so daft as to lie…  Saroja: So why did Manohar come ehh……may be you planned it all along and used him to kill your husband…  Simi: me using him??....huh…it was him all along…he  was sort of blackmailing me….threatening to tell Pramod….I was forced to go along….. please believe me...you are a woman…what will you do in my place?? … he threatened my home..family...husband…(she weeps) please.. I loved my husband….It was  Manohar’s gun….he  shot him..not me…  OPTIONAL:  QUICK CUTAWAY TO MANOHAR  Manohar contrite sitting with a banyan and shorts…speaking earnestly to Rasika who is watching him..  Manohar: I was forced to go along….She  was almost blackmailing me… threatening to inform  my bosses…inform you….please put me in my position…what was I supposed to do?? She threatened my family...my job….yes it was a mistake...but I loved only you…..it was her who pulled the trigger…not me… "

Simi:  Sorry…my tears are getting into my nose…please I have been punished enough…please let me go…  Akash:  What about Ms.  D’sa, eh?..I saw you push her over…  Simi: (suddenly loses it and shouts) Hey….is this a court or what??? You guys are killers too…..and I paying you to kill this creep…..(turns face to general direction of Akash) ..yes..I killed her..you also would have done the same….she would have identified Manohar straight away…as such strange people  were sending messages…  Akash: yes..that was  me…  Simi: Hell..Manohar was right…I should have killed you…instead of blinding you….  Akash: (to Murli) OK….That’s it…  There is some sound…. Simi is zapped..  Simi: what is?? (she is zapped more as she hears her own voice being played from a mobile…we see Murli holding one up..smiling)… is..is that a recording??  Akash: A great confession….thank you… you deserve a kiss…  He fumbles and brings his mouth near her ears….whispers ….  Akash: we are dead….if we are not together in this….

He goes off…enraged…gesticulating on phone….  Akash: What will you do Murli…  Murli: Don’t know sir….never had so much in my life…maybe..maybe get married??  At the back…Saroja escorts Simi out of the loo….She is still blindfolded.  Simi: I am telling you..there is no money..it’s a  lie…  Saroja is impassive.. "
	71	 Saroja: I heard on TV…  Simi: We lied to cover the death…..don’t you realize?  Saroja: You think we are fools?  Your boyfriend has agreed to hand over the money…you are lying…  Simi: Arre..why will I lie now?? What is more valuable..my life or 1 crore…  Saroja: I have met nobody who is more valuable than one crore…. 3 lakh will be max….that too if everything gets  sold…  A train thunders by in the night.   NEXT MORNING AT DR. SWAMI’S HOUSE.   Swami reads the paper at the veranda……he takes a sip of tea..looks up to see his son watching cartoon with TV on mute in the drawing room..….  He gets up..goes in…switches the TV off and comes back…  Swami: This time when I cut the cable...your mom  also won’t be able to get it back….understand…  Son: (SMIRKS) mom and I will go stay with granpa…   Swami sighs and sits….the nurse  Sandhya comes with some papers…he nods and picks it up…  Suddenly something catches his eyes..he sits up like a bolt….starts reading something avidly…then clutching some papers rush inside.. nurse is zapped..  Nurse: something wrong sir…  Swami: ehh…no..nothing…everything is fine….. 
"	72	   INT. MANOHAR HOUSE. DAY.   we catch Rasika and Manohar at the dining table.  He has just taken a vow never to look at another woman again. She is wrapping rubber bands on bundles of 2000 RUPEE NOTES.   THE LANDLINE RINGS…..Manohar puts the phone on SPEAKER and gives it to Rasika.  Hello? This time it’s Murli on the other side.  Manohar can’t recognize the voice. Murli: Is the money ready?  Rasika: Yes….ok….  Murli: Give the money and your cell phone to Manohar…And if he’s not listening, tell him I’ll be waiting at KALPATRU HEIGHTS at 10am.  Tell him to come alone or I will sell the tapes to news channels. They pay well too.  RASIKA HANGS UP.  Rasika coldly hands him his gun and says GO CLEAN UP THE MESS.   Manohar dips rusk in his tea and stares at her. The rusk disappears.   INT. HIDEOUT. DAY.  Murli shakes Akash by hand…  Murli: best of luck..when we come back we will drink and celebrate…  Saroja holds Akash and brings him to a chair…  Saroja: you will hurt yourself..please sit…  Akash sits..only to be caught by Murli against the chair as Saroja  quickly ties him..

"	73	 Akash: ehh…what happened ...why are you tying me up??  Saroja: we will be back in one hour. keep quiet..you are too bhola…..Simi will intimidate you or trick you….this is for your own good….   Simi laughs out hearing this…...     INT. HIDEOUT. DAY.   Simi: So… plans went wrong Mr. Akash..you seems  to be as tied up as I am…  Akash: Why don’t you keep quiet??  Simi: (laughs) so you have set out an amateur gang to meet Manohar for some fictitious money….Manohar will just eat them up… then come here and whip your ass. Meanwhile of course you planned to escape with that confession and create some problem for us……nothing like that is going to happen now of course….only I will like to see what Manohar does to you….  Akash: And once he has killed me it will be very easy for him to use the same gun to put a bullet through you too…saying the organ guys kidnapped both of us and killed us….that will take care of Rasika too….  Simi falls silent….  Akash: Not very cheerful now…are we??  Simi: You lie…  Akash: Why don’t you find out?? Yes, I hoped to escape but now we both are in equal danger. If the organ mafia returns without the money… I wonder whether they would spare either of us. Manohar or the gang… We will know in one hour.   "
	74	Simi: …tell me how are your hands tied..  Akash: Back to the chair why??  Simi: Lets come closer...you sing or shout…  Akash sings badly from the Spy From Shanghai..  Simi: you know only one song??  Akash sings …Simi scraping her chair….trying to get closer to him. It’s an odd sight.   …..she places her chair opposite to Akash… They are now back to back…..their fingers touch.   Simi: Hold still. I can feel the knots…. Akash: (snatches his hand away) I am not going to trust you ever again…  Simi: (laughs) So how will two blind people escape from a closed room my dear??? (We hear a train passing) don’t be  daft...I will still be tied here….I can guide you to escape….  Akash: Why will you do that??  Simi: Because….i can use that to bargain with the organ duo…Come on…i want to help you escape….Quick….we are losing time every minute….  CUT TO:    EXT. KALPATRU HEIGHTS. DAY.  In a top Angle shot we see MANOHAR GETS OFF HIS MOBIKE AND ENTER THE COMPLEX with a bag.   He stands under a board which says THIS PROPERTY IS UNDER COURT RECIEVER.

"	75	MURLI ON THE 11TH FLOOR is watching Manohar.  Murli: Go to the Lobby of C BLOCK Tower 6. Put the money in the Lift and wait outside. I will send the proof down. If you get into the lift, I won’t respond.        MANOHAR walks to the designated block and enters.  There is nobody there. But the lift is working. He looks around.   He opens the lift… And puts the BAG inside and shuts the lift.  A beat. And the LIFT STARTS GOING UP.  Manohar watches… the lift crosses First floor and MANOHAR STARTS RUNNING UP…SPRINTING ON THE STAIRS… TAKING TWO OR THREE STEPS AT A TIME…  MANOHAR RACING WITH THE LIFT…   Manohar is on the ninth floor when the lift stops at the 11th FLOOR.

Akash: There’s a balcony out there…..I heard a  pebble drop…..that’s not very high...I can make a rope out of the bedclothes and escape….the station is near…  Simi works on and the knots come loose…Akash leaps up…  He feels his way to the table and starts tearing bedclothes for the rope...  Simi: you forgot my blindfold… 
"	77	 Akash: No…I am not going to take that off.   Simi: You fool…I can guide you….I will still be tied… Come on. They should be back any moment…..  Akash deliberates….Yes….he could require some help.  He goes and takes off her eye tapes…..  Simi looks around wildly…. assessing the situation….. She sees some medical boxes….some  equipment…..  Simi: You will need to cut the bedsheets…..there is a box there….with equipment….maybe a knife or scalpel….. To your right….little left….  Akash gropes for the box. We realize that Simi is guiding him somewhat wrong. A bottle crashes….. Simi: Careful…..the box is on the left….  Meanwhile Simi is inching towards the medicine box which is on the right. But Akash manages to find a large piece of broken glass….He uses it to tear the bedsheet….   Simi:. But you will need another bedsheet….there is one under the bed….  Akash grops as we see Simi reach for a box of tools……near the Operating Table.  …..she tries to get the box open...but it falls and scatters on the  floor…  Akash stops, hearing the noise…  Akash: Simi……(no answer)…fuck…  Akash hurries to the balcony with his ‘rope’…tries tying it around the banister…  "
	78	Simi has picked up a razor thin scalpel….she is  working on her ropes….eyes…set in stone…on Akash…  Akash ties the rope as Simi tries to cut hers….  Akash has tied his rope’s end…he throws it over  and tries to get over….  Footsteps….he turns…he  cannot see……  A solid piece of iron pipe…. catches him by the jaw and he falls…   Simi: (now free and brandishing the weapon)….Bastard….  She hits Akash solidly …..he totters and falls…..AND WE HEAR THE SOUND OF A CAR. Simi stops.  Akash: They are back.  We hold on Akash….Simi has disappeared….

Akash in dark goggles plays…there is also a walking stick beside the piano…  The people turns and clap…Akash speaks in a microphone..

Playing blind for music and then really losing your eyes……And I was so sure you saw me and pulled a fast one with that piece...  Akash: (smiles sadly)…yes...it was like magic…I play and there you are…  Sophie: So Bernstein did not happen??  Akash: No…but I am more prepared this year….let’s see….

The farmer shoots…. the blind hare takes a running jump…. comes flying and hits the car’s windshield….   
"	87	Simi screams in shock/tries to turn the wheel…the car topples….turns turtle sideways a number of times…hits a milestone and drops in the field below…   Akash is stunned…he calls out..  Akash: Simi… He starts going towards the thud the overturned car made…..when the car explodes…Akash is thrown sideways on the road…  Akash tries to rise…but collapses….  LONDON PUB.  Akash smiles… Sophie stares at him…  Akash: I got my senses back after a couple of days…they said there was an accident…..I was  in Mumbai……thought of going back…but what would I say? Who would believe me?? So I managed to get abroad….     Sophie: That’s why they never found her…she died in the car… wonder how the accident happened…..  Akash finishes his coffee….  Sophie: (pensive) they found Manohar after about a week…he survived but left police….You know…..she was a complete bitch..… you should have taken her eyes…  Akash takes off the glasses and looks at Sophie…his eyes look like they used to…..For a second we wonder, is he blind or can he see?   Akash: (smiles) Do you think it’s easy to be a monster??  Akash claps for the waiter…  The waiter comes out…and hands Akash his cane…. Akash thanks him…We may or may not notice…..there is a hare’s head on the cane…..  Akash: Bye, Sophie….Hope to meet you more often…. "
	88	 CUT TO:  SOPHIE WATCHES….as Akash feels the street and gets down from the curb… he limps in one leg….but his strides are purposeful…he crosses by the zebra….a confident blind man walking down.  A car almost comes on the zebra….and barely misses him…Akash sidesteps instantly and then proceeds on his way again.  RONY:  The cab has come…  INSIDE CAB  Sophie is frowning as the cab pulls out…she turns back to see Akash..one can still see him take a turn …suddenly Sophie shouts..  Sophie: Stop the car…take a turn…go back….  A bewildered driver does that….RONY looks  at Sophie  Ronie: What happened??  Sophie: What if he has lied..what if he can see..what if all he told us did not happen..and he allowed Simi to be  sold and harvested her eyes??  Rony: wow..wow..not so fast….  Sophie: We only have his version of what he said…. what if he has made all up??...maybe it was not co-incidence…he saw me there and played that piece…. ….and you saw him cross that street….how could he side-step that car??   Rony: sometimes these men can hear far more acutely…you see when one organ……  They have arrived at the other side of the road….  Sophie jumps down..peeks in and shouts….  
"	89	Sophie: I need to know whether he is the same person I loved ….or has he become a monster…..   Sophie runs to the square… pigeons fly….she looks everywhere….she sees the evening crowd…but not Akash…   The camera moves to top….now we can see Akash walking by through streets… Sophie is looking for him too but is going further away…  As he walks….in CU we see the bobbing rabbit’s head…and then from top we see Akash hit a beer can on the sidewalk….  On the flying beer can…we cut to:  BLACK.   END TITLES BEGIN… a montage of piano clips of every Indian star who’s ever done a piano song…right from Saigal to Bhagwan to Dev Anand and Shammi Kapoor,Shashi Kapoor, and Raj Kapoor and Rajesh Khanna and Dharmendra and Vinod Mehra and Sunil Dutt and Raj Babbar and  Ashok Kumar and Rajendra Kumar and more and finally Pramod Sinha from a vintage film playing the piano….  He looks into camera and smiles.   FIN  	 "
