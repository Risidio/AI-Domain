"INT. PUB - NIGHT
A low ceiling, low lights and low-life customers. It's a room 
for people who need to get drunk. Nothing more.
The clothes on the customers say it's around 1850. The 
accents say the North of England.
In walks GUNNER, 40s, a titan of a man with calloused hands 
and a mop of curly hair tucked under a coal-stained cap. 
He has a squirming 13 year-old boy under his arm like a pig. 
GUNNER
This one of yours? 
He puts the boy on the floor. The boy stands up, trying to 
look bigger than he is. The Barman cuffs him on the head.
BARMAN
Where you been boy? Your ma's been 
giving me an earful.
GUNNER
He was poking his nose where he 
shouldn't.
The Barman looks concerned.
GUNNER (CONT’D)
I grabbed him before he got himself 
indebted to serious folk.
Barman visibly relaxes.
GUNNER (CONT’D)
Pint of mild.
The barman nods. Thank you.
He pulls the pint. As he does the door opens. Someone enters. 
The Barman flicks his gaze nervously at the person.
Gunner doesn't notice. Instead he downs the pint, barely 
tasting it. 
An ANCIENT KNIFE is put on the counter. It has been sharpened 
so many times the edge is shrinking back from the handle.
Gunner freezes, terror clear on his face.
We don't see the MAN. All we see is a light grey top hat and 
matching gloves being carefully placed on the bar.
A man speaks in an educated voice. Used to being obeyed.
MAN (O.S.)
You put your mark in my ledger."
"2.
GUNNER
I'm done with you and your curséd 
book.
MAN (O.S)
Your account cannot be voided so 
easily. Someone will have to pay 
the bill.
Gunner glances at the knife.
GUNNER
You can't expect me to.
The Man chuckles.
MAN (O.S.)
No, that isn't for your debt, it's 
for your betrayal. Did you think I 
wouldn't find out?
The top hat and gloves are picked up off the bar. 
MAN (CONT’D)
Pay now or it passes to your 
family, with interest.
We hear the sound of heavy footsteps and a cane walking away.
Gunner looks at the Barman's son. He shakes his head. How did 
it come to this? He knows how.
GUNNER
You'll tell my kin? I did this for 
them.
The Barman nods and pours him a double and pushes it across 
the bar. 
BARMAN
For the road.
Gunner downs the shot and then reaches for the knife, holding 
it close TO HIS OWN THROAT.
GUNNER
Damn that Bill Lyle.
A deep breath. A smooth cut. The job is done.
EXT. CANAL SIDE - EARLY MORNING
A ramshackle NARROW BOAT is moored up on the side of the 
canal. 
The boat's grey paint is peeling, 'CHARON' is visible on the 
side in faded blue. "
"3.
The chimney at the front of the boat gently puffs out smoke. 
A group of men in scruffy clothes struggle to unload A BODY 
WRAPPED IN RAGS from the boat.
One of the crew turns to look down the canal path.
WEASEL, 40s, well-worn like his clothes.
Weasel frowns into the distance. Watching something. 
Squinting against the sun. 
It takes him a moment to realise what he is looking at. When 
he does he's not impressed.
WEASEL
No matter what you are selling, I'm 
not interested.
We see who he is talking to, JOSEPHINE, 16 wiry, DRESSED AS A 
BOY in scruffy clothes. Dark hair tucked away in a cap. She's 
carrying a BOAT HOOK.
JOSEPHINE
That doesn't look legal.
WEASEL
It don't concern you, boy.
Weasel makes a show of helping unload the body, but he's 
clearly doing as little lifting as possible.
JOSEPHINE
Perhaps, but it might be of 
interest to the magistrate.
Weasel steps away from the body, causing it to nearly be 
dropped in the water. 
He marches towards Josephine.
WEASEL
What do you want?
With a thud the body lands on the canal side behind Weasel. 
The cloth covering falls open to reveal an agonised face. 
Dried blood trails from the eyes. The skin of the body is 
covered with red boils. 
Unfazed Josephine responds.
JOSEPHINE
Employment.
Weasel sizes up Josephine. Behind him all but one of the crew 
board the boat."
"4.
BOSUN, 30s, Flat cap, and a thick beard. His coat is missing 
the sleeves. His giant tattooed arms hint that might be a 
choice rather than an accident. He stands over the body.
BOSUN
This ain't right. Yeoman deserves 
better.
Weasel speaks over his shoulder. 
WEASEL
We were all warned not to mess with 
it. He only had to listen, and 
obey.
(To Josephine)
We've got nothing for you.
BOSUN
Can we give him six feet?  
WEASEL
No time.
Bosun shakes his head.
WEASEL (CONT’D)
You knew what you signed up for.
JOSEPHINE
It appears you are short a crew.
WEASEL
We'll manage.
Weasel spits on the floor and climbs back on the boat. 
Josephine's posture sags, but her eyes are still sharp. Not 
giving up. Changing tactics.
JOSEPHINE
Please sir, I ain't got no kin, the 
only proof I even exist is a debt 
my father left me. 
Weasel glances at her with cold eyes. He does not care.
JOSEPHINE (CONT’D)
A debt to Mr Lyle.
One the crew flinches.
WEASEL
Not my concern.
STOKER speaks next. 60s, heavy set with a round belly, his 
clothes are a hodgepodge of old army uniforms. All stained 
with coal dust and oil.
He talks directly to Josephine from the cockpit of the boat."
"5.
STOKER
You're witnessing a rarity. Mr 
Weasel is doing you a kindness. 
You'd be wise to thank him and be 
on your way.
Stoker fills a pipe with tobacco. He looks at Josephine, 
weighing something in his mind. He puts a match to his pipe.
STOKER (CONT’D)
And your father wouldn't have 
forgiven us if we'd let you join.
WEASEL
Wait, what?
STOKER
It's Gunner's child. Look at the 
eyes. Doesn't have his height yet, 
but...
WEASEL
You want to follow in your father's 
steps then?
JOSEPHINE
How else am I supposed to service 
his debt?
Weasel narrows his eyes. Calculating.
WEASEL
You'll follow orders, with no 
insolence?
Weasel throws a look at Stoker. Josephine stands straight.
JOSEPHINE
Yes sir.
WEASEL
And you aren't a traitor like your 
father was?
Bosun and Stoker stand, as if to fight.
STOKER
Gunner never betrayed us.
WEASEL
He betrayed Mr Lyle.
(turning to Josephine)
Well boy, are you a traitor?
Bosun and Stoker look to Josephine. This is clearly a test.
JOSEPHINE
I seek work, not trouble."
"6.
WEASEL
We've gathered that. I'm trying to 
ascertain if you are a snivelling 
wretch like your father was.
BOSUN
You'd never dare call him that to 
his face.
WEASEL
And my throat remains uncut. What 
do you say?
Josephine nods a little. Weasel scowls at her. Okay.
WEASEL (CONT’D)
Food and a cot for you, and perhaps 
absolution from your rat father.
Weasel glances at Stoker and Bosun. Daring them to say 
something. Neither are pleased with this offer.
He spits in his hand and holds it out, almost jabbing 
Josephine in the ribs. 
STOKER
You best know, step on-board and 
you'll be leaving your childhood on 
the canal side.
Josephine looks Weasel in the eye and spits in her own hand 
before grasping his.
JOSEPHINE
You can call me Joe.
Stoker shakes his head. Disappointed.
WEASEL
Let's be away, Stoker.
STOKER
Right you are.
Stoker rings a bell. The sound coming from the engine 
increases. Bosun unties the boat from the shore and hops 
onboard, followed by Weasel. They all look at Josephine.
WEASEL
Come along, boy. We won't be piping 
you on board.
Josephine steps onto the boat, wobbling a little. The Charon 
slowly pulls away from the shoreline.
Weasel GRABS Josephine and drags her to the middle of the 
boat by the back of her shirt. "
"7.
A CRATE is lashed to the deck with a canvas shroud pulled 
over it. Weasel holds Josephine close to the crate.
WEASEL (CONT’D)
There are only two things you need 
to squeeze into that tiny head of 
yours. This box holds death and on 
this boat, my word is law.
Weasel lets Josephine go, she tumbles down to the deck. 
Josephine looks around, the rest of the crew avoid her gaze. 
For a moment we see defiance, and then she lowers her head.
The side of Weasel's mouth twitches, he's enjoying himself.
EXT. CHARON - DAY
The canal boat motors smoothly through the water. Apart from 
the gentle put-put of the steam engine the world is quiet.
Stoker mans the tiller, watching the water carefully.
We see a magpie tangled in a net on the bank. The bird 
struggles hopelessly.
JOSEPHINE
One for sorrow.
BOSUN
Aye, for the bird.
STOKER
That doesn't tide well.
Stoker pulls out his knife, and pushes himself up.
BOSUN
If I had a shilling for every one 
of your tidings...
WEASEL
No stopping. For anything. He's 
quite resolute about that.
STOKER
She'll eat six bags of the coal a 
shift, more if we are pushing her. 
There is no way we can carry enough 
for the entire trip. Crew need 
victuals and all. Corky's got 
barely half a bag of flour left.
Stoker watches the magpie until it's out of sight.
WEASEL
Ten days to Leeds?"
"8.
STOKER
More or less.
Weasel fidgets nearby, checking a pocket watch, a letter on 
brown wax paper and then his gun. He repeats. Pocket watch. 
Letter. Gun. Again.
WEASEL
What if we moved at night as well?
STOKER
Six days, there abouts. For that 
we'll need lamp oil. I expect Mr 
Lyle would have opinions if we were 
to sink with his cargo.
Weasel considers this.
WEASEL
He'll have opinions on these extra 
costs.
STOKER
What happened to the previous crew?
They glare at each other. Bosun shuffles down the boat.
BOSUN
Let's get the new one on flotsam 
duty. Give them a chance to earn 
their keep.
Stoker nods. He waves a finger at Josephine, come over.
STOKER
Do you know how to use that?
He motions to the boat hook in her hand.
JOSEPHINE
It's a stick? I think I understand 
the fundamentals.
Bosun snorts. Stoker gives him a look. Don't encourage her. 
WEASEL
Less of that lip, boy.
Bosun takes the boat hook out of Josephine's hand.
BOSUN
Charon's a heavy old girl, she 
needs a bit of help on the river.
He stabs into the water, when he pulls the hook out it has a 
rag wrapped around it."
"9.
BOSUN (CONT’D)
It doesn't look like much, but even 
one of these dragging on her hull 
will slow us down.
STOKER
Can't afford dead weight.
Look there from Stoker, at Weasel and Josephine.
BOSUN
Exactly. Now come with me, let's 
get you set up on the prow. Don't 
look so grim. It's exhausting work 
but at least the hours are long.
A wink. He sidles down the boat, Josephine follows him. 
Weasel watches her go.
MEHRA (O.S.)
Stoker! I'd heard you were dead.
We see another steam powered narrow boat approaching from the 
other direction. It's shiny and bright, fresh from the docks.
The man at the helm, MEHRA, 50s, huge moustache, turban, 
grins at Stoker with delight.
STOKER
No time for that Mehra, not when 
there's work to be done. 
Mehra chuckles as his boat smoothly glides past The Charon.
MEHRA
Always the way.
STOKER
She's looking prime.
Stoker nods towards the other boat.
MEHRA
Thank you, Mr Stoker. Where are you 
blessing with your presence next?
Before Stoker can reply, Weasel interjects.
WEASEL
London.
Mehra looks at Weasel, surprised. Why lie? Stoker shakes his 
head - don't ask.
MEHRA
Well, good luck to you, where ever 
you are headed."
"10.
Stoker nods as Mehra's boat glides away from them. 
STOKER
No need to lie to river folk.
Weasel scowls at Stoker and then turns to watch Mehra's boat 
disappear into the distance. He speaks quietly.
WEASEL
We're not the second crew.
STOKER
What happened to the others?
WEASEL
Does it matter?
Stoker looks towards Bosun and Josephine on the bow of the 
boat. Bosun towers over Josephine.
STOKER
Cruel to let the boy join us.
WEASEL
He's paying a debt, same as you. 
Same as me.
EXT. CHARON PROW - DAY
We see Josephine stands on the prow of the boat, watching the 
water intently. She hears laughter and looks up at the shore.
EXT. WELL TENDED CANAL PATH - DAY
A young couple walk along the canal. Travelling the opposite 
direction. Their clothes are clean and new, Sunday best.
The man raises his wide-brimmed hat to Josephine.
EXT. LOCK - DAY
The canal is punctuated by a series of locks. These gates 
allow boats to traverse changes in height of the water. A 
small Lock Keeper's cottage sits to one side.
The LOCK KEEPER, 50s, thinning hair with a grimy clothes, 
appears as the Charon approaches the locks. He waves to 
Stoker who nods back.
WEASEL
Not very chatty today, Stoker? 
Normally you two are yabbling at 
each other like fish wives."
"11.
Weasel looks around. A few people are lounging about, some 
draped over railings near the canal. Others leaning against 
trees. No one is in a hurry.
Stoker leans down and yanks a rope. A bell at the prow of the 
boat rings. A few moments later the pace of the steam engine 
changes. 
Water bubbles around the stern of the boat as the propeller 
switches into reverse.
The Charon slows. Josephine wobbles a little on the prow of 
the boat.
Ahead of them the Lock Keeper pushes the first set of locks 
open, as he does he coughs. Stoker and Bosun both snap their 
heads to look. 
The Lock Keeper taps a sequence on the heavy beam.
Stoker nods. Bosun walks down the narrow boat towards Stoker. 
He speaks in a low whisper.
BOSUN
Shall I fetch the long gun?
STOKER
Steady for now.
JOSEPHINE
What's going on?
STOKER
(shouting)
Steady.
(whispering to Josephine)
 Unwelcome guests.
Josephine looks around, clearly unsettled.
STOKER (CONT’D)
(whispering)
Bosun, spot anyone you recognise?
Bosun leans back like he doesn't have a care in the world.
BOSUN
(loudly)
Looks like it's going to be nice 
today. Not too hot. Not too cold. 
Proper Yorkshire weather. 
He looks around at the sky, and then also glances at the 
people waiting around the lock."
"12.
BOSUN (CONT’D)
Lot of men to be hanging around a 
lock of a morning, but no one 
particular...
STOKER
Is that Deacon on the right there, 
by the tree? 
Bosun stretches, and looks over.
BOSUN
Last I heard he was up to his neck 
with Mrs Weaver and her boys.
STOKER
Wouldn't be the first time someone 
fell back on unsavoury behaviour to 
settle a debt would it, Bosun.
BOSUN
Desperate people, desperate times, 
Stoker. 
There is a shared look there. A private joke that is too true 
to be funny. A hint of sadness.
JOSEPHINE
Are we in trouble?
The boat is now fully inside the lock. The gate to the lock 
closes slowly behind them.
Stoker rings the bell again. Three short rings. The steam 
engines slow to an idle.
The Charon is surrounded by high walls. A perfect trap.
STOKER
This cargo. Does it justify the 
perils.
A sluice gate is opened. Water slowly flows in. The level of 
the canal inside the lock rises, taking the Charon with it.
WEASEL
Get it to Leeds. That's all you 
need to know.
Stoker looks Weasel in the eye. Weasel holds his gaze. He's 
not bluffing. Stoker looks away first.
STOKER
Bosun, Fetch the gun and get Corky 
out here.
(MORE)"
"13.
STOKER (CONT’D)
Mr Weasel, if you felt like giving 
that revolver of yours a clean, so 
everyone can see it, well, I 
wouldn't be entirely against the 
idea.
Weasel frowns and then he pulls out his pistol. 
The Charon slowly rises as more water fills the lock.
Bosun shuffles down the boat. Stoker leans forward and pulls 
out a KNIFE from near the tiller.
WEASEL
The boy, shouldn't he be armed as 
well?
Stoker brings out a whetstone and starts running it along the 
blade of the knife. Stoker looks up at Josephine.
STOKER
Have you ever been in a fight?
JOSEPHINE
I can look after myself.
Stoker eyes Josephine up, twisting the knife in his hand. 
He's thinking. He glances at Josephine's hands.
STOKER
Get below decks.
Weasel looks at Stoker - What?
STOKER (CONT’D)
The child might be the greatest 
fighter the world has ever seen, 
but they don't look like much. 
That's the wrong way round for what 
we need right now.
JOSEPHINE
I...
WEASEL
You heard him, get below.
Josephine ducks into the doorway at the front of the ship, 
catching the boat hook as she does.
The boat rises with the water, but the crew still can't see 
outside of the lock.
CORKY, 20, appears on deck from the engine room with a wood 
chopping axe in his hand, carrying it with practised ease.
He has a mess of curly hair half covering a pretty face that 
work hasn't yet weathered. "
"14.
Bosun climbs onto the top of the boat, a long rifle cradled 
in his massive arms. He works the action a couple of times 
before loading it.
Because he's on top of the ship, Bosun is the first to see 
out of the lock. 
He gently lays the rifle down and raises his hands. 
The boat rises.
WEASEL (CONT’D)
Bosun?
We finally see the top of the lock.
The Charon is surrounded by a half dozen men, armed with 
shotguns and long hooked blades.
They look as though they haven't eaten well for a while.
The Lock Keeper kneels nearby. A gun pressed against the back 
of his head.
One of the gang speaks. It's DEACON, 30s, pale with a sweat 
on his brow. Bags under his eyes. A dented bowler hat is 
perched on his head, he's smoking the end of a cigar.
DEACON
How do, Stoker.
(Moves the cigar to the 
other side of his mouth)
A cut of what you are hauling and 
we can get on with our days.
STOKER
We don't have time for your 
highwayman claptrap, Deacon.
Deacon pulls back the hammer on the pistol.
Stoker looks at Weasel. Weasel's eyes are wild, he goes to 
raise his gun. Stoker gently stops him. 
STOKER (CONT’D)
Mr Weasel, perhaps your tongue can 
do us more good than your gun can 
right now. 
Weasel looks around.
WEASEL
We can't be lopping a piece off for 
every beggar we meet.
DEACON
Then we'll take the whole thing."
"15.
WEASEL
This ain't for the likes of you, 
boy.
DEACON
How about we kill you all, and then 
have a little look?
STOKER
Walk away, Deacon.
Weasel cocks the hammer on his revolver. The gang raise their 
shotguns in response.
DEACON
I'll count to three. By the time 
I've finished you better be taking 
an overdue bath, or...
Josephine appears from below deck. She has a FLAMING RAG on 
the end of a stick in her hand. Deacon watches her. What's 
this?
DEACON (CONT’D)
It will take more than a little 
fire to send us running.
A few of the gang members chuckle.
JOSEPHINE
If you understood what was in the 
boat, you'd already be flashing 
your ankles.
DEACON
You must be new. You're not going 
to scare us off with riddles.
A few more chuckles. Deacon's enjoying this.
JOSEPHINE
What about explosives?
DEACON
All this for a box of grenades?
Josephine points below her, inside the ship.
JOSEPHINE
Do you think Bill Lyle would 
concern himself with grenades? 
We're carrying world-cracking 
explosives. New inventions from the 
Crimea. If I drop this rag the 
explosion will be enough to knock 
the whiskers off St Peter's face."
"16.
DEACON
You're bluffing.
Josephine gulps. Her throat is dry.
JOSEPHINE
Maybe, but if we try to stop you, 
we're dead. If Mr Lyle hears that 
we abandoned our job, we're dead. I 
figure this way at least I get to 
see how far your boots go. What do 
you reckon Mr Weasel? Coventry?
Josephine fake drops the rag, and catches it again. 
A few of the gang members wince but they aren't spooked.
Slowly Josephine pulls a pinch of something out of her 
pocket. Holding her hand steady like the contents is 
incredibly precious.
She looks Deacon dead in the eye and with a theatrical 
flourish she tosses what is in her hand towards the rag.
WHOOMP. 
A fireball bellows out, leaving a cloud of black smoke.
Deacon dives to the floor, the rest of his gang cower away. 
The crew on the boat duck for cover. 
Only Josephine and Stoker don't react.
No one speaks for a long while.
STOKER
I'll put a crown on Banbury.
The gang members stand up again but their spirit is broken. 
Some of them back away.
WEASEL
Windsor at least. We've got ten 
tonnes below deck. Why it's a 
miracle it's not gone off already 
with you smoking that cigar, 
Deacon.
Deacon spits his cigar out, it lands in the water with a 
fizzle.
Both groups stare at each other. 
Deacon watches Josephine, and the rag burning in her hand.
A crow cries out in the distance."
"17.
STOKER
(In a low calm voice)
Bosun, get the lock gate.
Bosun slowly lowers his hands. No one stops him.
He leaps off the boat into the side of the canal, unlatches 
the gate and slowly pushes it open. Deacon frowns, helpless.
STOKER (CONT’D)
Steam please, Corky. As much as you 
can manage. We're running late.
Corky nods in reply and disappears below deck, and a few 
moments later the sound of the steam engine changes. 
Charon slowly gets up to speed and makes her way up the 
river.
DEACON
(shouting)
This isn't over.
Weasel salutes to him, and grins at Josephine. He slaps 
Stoker on the back.
WEASEL
I knew Joe would be useful.
STOKER
You're not thinking ahead.
WEASEL
What?
STOKER
Deacon won't give up. Not now he 
knows we're hauling for Old Bill.
Weasel looks back at the lock, then ahead down the canal. 
Dread fills his eyes as he works it out.
JOSEPHINE
How many locks to Leeds?
STOKER
Enough and next time they'll have a 
plan  probably involving lead. By 
tomorrow every gang and petty thief 
with dreams this side of The Humber 
will have designs on our cargo. The 
reputation of our employer and his 
temper like hell won't do-naught.
Weasel turns to Josephine."
"18.
WEASEL
If you've killed us, boy. I'll wear 
your pearly whites as cuff-links.
STOKER
(To Joe)
That's nothing compared to what 
Corky will do when he realises you 
burned the last of his flour to 
make your pretty fireball.
EXT. CHARON - DAY
The Charon continues its stately progress through the 
countryside. Bosun works the tiller, Stoker sits on the 
cabin, smoking his pipe.
Josephine stands at the prow, holding the boat hook. Scanning 
the water. Nearby Corky watches her pretending to fix some 
rope.
She stabs at something in the water. Misses. Stabs again. 
Another miss.
She narrows her eyes, this time.
Stab. Nothing. Josephine's shoulders sag.
Corky puts the rope down and gently takes the boat hook out 
of her hands. 
He's perfectly still. Then so fast we can barely see him move 
he stabs at the water.
Splash.
A fish flaps wildly at the end of the boat hook.
Corky smiles, hands the boat hook back back to Josephine. 
Stoker interrupts the moment.
STOKER
Nice catch, seems like you're 
getting the hang of it at last.
Josephine takes the dead fish off the pole, placing it on a 
handkerchief. She resumes her duty. Scanning the water.
STOKER (CONT’D)
Although I'd rather you focused on 
flotsam than fish.
JOSEPHINE
It bewilders me that there are fish 
in this water."
"19.
STOKER
Aye. There is no-where so wretched 
or disgusting that life won't even 
try. Take London for example.
Josephine reluctantly smiles.
EXT. ABANDONED LOCK - DUSK
The Charon motors on. The engine is the only sound we hear.
The Lock ahead is deserted, a few houses cluster around the 
mechanism. An overturned cart lies near the water.
No other boats, no people and no lock keepers. 
JOSEPHINE
No one here. That's good right?
STOKER
For as long as it stays that way.
Stoker rings the bell, once, softly. The tone of the engine 
changes slightly. Charon slows. 
Stoker points to Josephine.
STOKER (CONT’D)
Get the Lock open, fast as you can.
Josephine jumps off the boat and races towards the first 
wooden Lock Gate. She pushes her entire weight into the 
handle, but it doesn't budge.
She turns back to the boat.
JOSEPHINE
(Shouting)
It won't move!
The noise makes everyone flinch. Bosun hisses a reply
BOSUN
Keep your damn voice down.
Josephine freezes and looks around. An owl hoots in the 
distance. She speaks in a stage whisper.
JOSEPHINE
Why isn't the Lock Keeper helping?
Bosun - with the rifle in his hand - leaps from the boat.
BOSUN
Most probably on account of him 
being dead."
"20.
Josephine peers towards the cottage. The door is ajar, and 
swinging slightly in the breeze.
JOSEPHINE
What?
BOSUN
Fire's out, Keeper's missing and 
none of his damn kids are trying to 
hawk us scrumpy. Get the sluice 
open.
He peers over his shoulder, squinting into the trees around 
the Lock. There are hints of movement in the darkness. Could 
be figures. Could be nothing.
EXT. CHARON COCKPIT - DUSK
Stoker is at the tiller, as always. Weasel slumps against the 
rear of the cabin. He's cradling a hip flask in his hands.
Weasel pushes himself up and looks towards the Lock.
WEASEL
Why aren't we going in?
STOKER
The Lock is drained. We need to 
bring the level up.
WEASEL
That going to take long?
STOKER
It will take as long as it does.
(A deep breath)
You want to know if it's a trap?
WEASEL
No. 
(Yes)
STOKER
I'm not saying for definite. But it 
does have all the hallmarks, and 
every tick of the clock's hand 
makes it more likely. Maybe I will 
have that drink.
Weasel passes the flask over and peers into the darkness. 
Stoker takes a swig, he wince and then nods. Pretty good.
EXT. ABANDONED LOCK - DUSK
Bosun stands with one foot on the lock. Rifle in his hands."
"21.
JOSEPHINE
(whispering)
I can't get it to move.
BOSUN
(whispering)
Push it lad. Give it some welly.
JOSEPHINE
It won't...
Bosun sighs. Looks around one last time and then rests the 
rifle against top of the Lock. He spits on his hands and goes 
over to help Josephine with the sluice gate.
A flock of birds take off from the trees. Bosun doesn't look. 
INT. CHARON - DUSK
Stoker looks at the abandoned Lock Keeper's cottage. Behind 
him, on the shore we see movement in the trees.
STOKER
If we pull this off, might we end 
up in his good books?
WEASEL
He doesn't have good books.
STOKER
Well I'd settle for not being in 
his bad ones.
Stoker passes the bottle back to Weasel.
STOKER (CONT’D)
Have you ever shot that gun of 
yours?
WEASEL
Shot a goose once.
STOKER
Then let us hope that any we meet 
with ill-intentions are inclined to 
lay eggs. What's taking them so 
damn long?
EXT. ABANDONED LOCK - DUSK
Bosun's arms shake with the effort of trying to open the 
gate. It won't budge.
He leans over the edge of the gate, and sees something 
sticking out of the side."
"22.
Bosun reaches down and grabs it, shaking and twisting it to 
get it loose. With a soft thwack it comes out.
JOSEPHINE
It's open.
Bosun holds the object up to see it in the light. It's long 
HUMAN LEG BONE. Covered in strange dark markings.
Bosun drops the bone onto the ground and rubs his hand on his 
trousers. He looks around, worry in his eyes.
EXT. CHARON - DUSK
Stoker peers into the darkness.
STOKER
Here we go.
The Charon glides into the Lock, neatly bumping the gate.
WEASEL
Watch it.
STOKER
Calm yourself Mr Weasel.
WEASEL
Crack that box and half the 
county's dead.
Weasel rushes over to the cargo and checks it's still lashed 
down. He scowls at Stoker.
EXT. TREES NEAR ABANDONED LOCK - DUSK
From the point of view of unseen observers we see the boat, 
with Weasel examining the crate.
Josephine and Bosun lean against the first Lock Gate, pushing 
it open. As they push Bosun glances over his shoulder into 
the night.
Bosun turns and looks towards the observers the trees, what 
was that?
EXT. ABANDONED LOCK - DUSK
Josephine looks around. Are we in trouble?
Together they work the lock mechanisms, with Bosun carefully 
keeping his rifle ready at all times.
The water level inside the Lock sinks with the Charon."
"23.
Stoker looks up to Bosun. Realising he has his attention, 
Bosun makes a series of hand gestures towards Stoker.
Stoker immediately pulls out his knife.
EXT. CHARON - DUSK
From the view of the people on the boat we see Bosun slowly  
obscured by the ground as the water level inside the lock 
falls. In moments he is completely hidden. 
Weasel pulls himself into a standing position. He touches 
Stoker's shoulder and places his hand on his gun - Am I going 
to need this?
A nod from Stoker.
The canal level continues to sink inside the Lock. All we can 
hear is the rushing of water.
Weasel readies his gun, easing back the hammer on the 
revolver as slowly as possible to not make a noise. The click 
as it finally cocks feels incredibly loud.
A glance from Stoker, but approving. Good. Be ready.
They both scan the rectangle of sky they can see above them. 
Hunting for movement.
Weasel glances at the crate. It's still there. Past the crate 
we see Corky with an axe in his hand.
Stoker taps Weasel on the arm. Look at that.
We see the HEAD OF A MAN emerge from the receding water. A 
thick chain is wound around his neck. Weasel gasps.
As the water level falls more of the body is exposed. It 
floats next to them, tethered by the neck. Weasel can't stop 
looking at it.
More bodies appear. A whole family.
He slowly lowers his gun, the barrel weaves.
Stoker kicks Weasel in the foot. Breaking the spell. Gestures 
at Weasel's pistol and then up at the sky. Danger's that way.
We hear the bodies gently knock against the side of the boat. 
Thud. Splash. Thud. Splash.
Weasel takes another swig from the flask, making a point of 
facing in the direction away from the bodies. 
Stoker is utterly still, watching for movement, knife ready."
"24.
STOKER
(Under his breath)
Come on, Bosun.
The gate in front of them shudders, and then slowly opens, 
revealing the canal ahead.
Stoker gestures towards Corky. He disappears below deck. 
We hear a thud and a clunk. A something breaking thud. The 
steam engine is silent.
Corky reappears. He looks worried. 
STOKER (CONT’D)
Not again?
Corky nods.
WEASEL
What?
STOKER
(Irish)
Dia ár sábháil
(A breath, okay. Focus)
Get a rope. They'll have to pull us 
out.
Corky scrambles out of the hatch and rushes to the front of 
the boat, scooping up a rope on the way.
EXT. ABANDONED LOCK - DUSK
Bosun and Josephine look down at the stationery Charon.
JOSEPHINE
Are those his children?
BOSUN
The engine's gone, go help.
EXT. TREES NEAR ABANDONED LOCK - DUSK
From the view of an observer in the trees, we see Bosun 
crouched by the lock gate, rifle ready. Scanning the trees.
Josephine runs down the steps to the lower canal path.
EXT. ABANDONED LOCK - DUSK
Josephine appears on the canal side. Corky throws a rope.
Josephine looks behind her. Something's caught her attention. 
The rope lands in the water."
"25.
Corky gathers the rope up, tensing for a throw and points at 
the rope - Are you ready? She nods in reply. 
He throws. She reaches for it, stepping forward. As she grabs 
it, she tumbles towards the water.
With a jerk she stops moving. Bosun has caught her. 
He yanks her back, the cap tumbles off her head. Letting her 
long hair free. Terror on her face. 
She snatches the cap out of the air with her free hand, and 
pulls it back onto her head. Bosun lifts her up and places 
her on the canal side like she was a doll. 
She turns to Bosun - ready to explain - while she tucks the 
rest of her hair away. 
He's looking in the other direction. Watching the trees. Did 
he even see it happen? She pulls the cap back on.
Bosun watches the tree line, rifle ready. 
Josephine gradually pulls The Charon out of the lock. The 
boat eases down the canal and slowly towards the bank. 
EXT. CHARON - DUSK
Josephine jumps on board followed by Bosun.
BOSUN
Watch the trees. If they come.
He passes Josephine the gun, she holds it awkwardly.
BOSUN (CONT’D)
Did you try the regulator?
Another nod from Corky.
JOSEPHINE
What's wrong?
BOSUN
Been giving us problems since 
Newcastle.
Bosun disappears below deck and works on the engine.
Corky and Josephine watch both sides of the river. Peering 
into the near darkness for movement.
Corky taps Josephine on her shoulder. He points at her head. 
A tangle of long brown hair is free of Josephine's cap. 
Corky gently lifts up the cap, and tucks her hair away. He 
looks her in the eye. Understanding."
"26.
Before Josephine can say anything we hear something metal 
being hit with a hammer. Bosun curses.
There is a splash on the water, as an animal dives into the 
canal. The crew jump.
The steam engine turns over. Slowly at first and then with 
confidence. Bosun appears, covered in soot but looking proud.
They are moving now. Not safe, but less easy prey.
Behind Bosun, we see FIGURES in ragged black and white 
clothes emerge from the darkness. They watch the Charon leave 
and then slip away into the trees.
EXT. OFFICE - DUSK
A plush wooden office. Thick green leather covers a dark wood 
desk. A grand chair sits behind the desk. Two decidedly less 
grand chairs are in front of it.
The walls are covered with exotic items from around the 
world. Giant bird feathers and shields made of animal skins.
Deacon walks through, followed by HUGHES, 30, tall and strong 
like an oak tree. His waistcoat and trouser are immaculate, 
in sharp contrast to Deacon.
HUGHES
Wait here. Watch your language and 
remember you're nothing to her. 
(A frown)
Take that damn hat off.
Deacon snatches the dented bowler hat off his head. And 
waits. After a few moments he gingerly sits down in one of 
the chairs in front of the desk.
The door creeks open. Deacon jumps to attention, he looks 
around. It's AN OLD CLEANING WOMAN in plain clothes.
He relaxes as she brushes the floor. Deacon sits back down 
and flips his hat in his hands a couple of times.
OLD CLEANING WOMAN
I do not recall granting you 
permission to sit.
Deacon jumps out of the chair.
The Old Cleaning Woman walks around the desk, hangs up her 
ragged shawl and puts on an silk dressing gown. She ties her 
hair up and slowly applies some lipstick, ignoring Deacon.
It takes him a a few heartbeats to realise what is going on. "
"27.
DEACON
I'm, I'm sorry Mrs Weaver, I didn't 
mean no harm. I didn't realise it 
was you.
She sits down and pulls out a gold cigarette case. She takes 
one cigarette and then holds it out offering him one.
As he reaches forward she snaps the case closed, almost 
catching Deacon's fingers. He flinches away.
MRS WEAVER
Well?
Deacon gulps. Running his fingers along the rim of his hat.
DEACON
It's a bomb or something. We tried 
to take it at the locks but they 
threatened to blow it up, and us 
with it. One of the crew, big lad, 
had a flaming rag right next to it. 
You could see in his eyes he was 
prepared to do it. Probably back 
from the Crimea. He set off a pinch 
of it. As a warning.
Deacon mimes a gigantic explosion
DEACON (CONT’D)
Such a fulmination! A speck of it 
was enough to knock us onto our 
heels.
MRS WEAVER
I trust you didn't come here to 
tell me all the ways you failed.
Deacon glances at the door. Maybe I could run?
DEACON
It belongs to Bill Lyle, I thought 
that would be of interest. 
Ms Weaver sizes him up. Deacon can see his moment. He reaches 
into his pockets and pulls out a crumpled piece of paper.
He points to the desk. Mrs Weaver nods. Okay then. Deacon 
unfolds the paper and places it in front of Mrs Weaver.
DEACON (CONT’D)
This is where they are right now.
He points to a marker on the map.
MRS WEAVER
You drew this?"
"28.
DEACON
Yes, Mrs Weaver. I had a life 
before, all this.
(a deep breath)
They are here give or take a mile.
He points at a place on the map.
DEACON (CONT’D)
They'll have to take this tunnel to 
get to Mr Lyle. It's long, low and 
dark. Being in the dark like that 
for so long, it messes with the 
eyes.
MRS WEAVER
A point, Deacon.
DEACON
They'll be blinking like newborn 
moles when they come out into the 
daylight on the other side.
He makes an attempt at miming what this would look like.
DEACON (CONT’D)
That's where we would take them, I 
mean, take it. I need ten of your 
boys. Ones that aren't afraid of a 
bit of argy-bargy.
MRS WEAVER
Ten?
DEACON
Stoker often has Gunner on board. I 
didn't see him but if it's precious 
to Mr Lyle he will be there.
A nod. She knows of Gunner. Mrs Weaver leans back. 
MRS WEAVER
This is a risky plan, Deacon.
She grabs a walnut from a silver dish on her desk. She cracks 
the walnut open with her fingers. Deacon winces.
DEACON
There are risks, but I've planned 
around them.
He gestures to the map in front of them.
MRS WEAVER
And expensive.
This takes the wind out of Deacon's sails."
"29.
MRS WEAVER (CONT’D)
Now now, Deacon. Don't look like 
that. I'm not Mr Lyle. In fact I am 
quite the opposite. Where he loads 
souls with debt, I give them hope.
She breaks into a beaming, crocodile smile.
MRS WEAVER (CONT’D)
Hughes!
Hughes immediately appears he clearly doesn't like him.
MRS WEAVER (CONT’D)
See that Deacon gets the use of a 
dozen of our best men.
Deacon allows himself a nervous smile.
MRS WEAVER (CONT’D)
If this works, you could find 
yourself elevated in the world, 
Deacon. Perhaps treat yourself to a 
new hat. If not. Well.
Mrs Weaver shoos him away with hand. Deacon flees the room.
MRS WEAVER (CONT’D)
Add the costs of this operation to 
Deacon's tab. It's his idea after 
all.
Hughes nods.
EXT. CHARON - DUSK
Stoker is on the tiller with Weasel next to him. Josephine 
leans against the cabin, and Bosun is on top. Each of them 
has a metal mug of tea in their hands. 
Soft rain splashes on the water.
BOSUN
I'll set the lamps.
Bosun disappears below deck and reappears with couple of oil 
lamps on the end of metal poles. 
The lamps weakly light up the river ahead and behind.
BOSUN (CONT’D)
Are we on first watch?
Stoker looks around."
"30.
STOKER
No, Joe with me. The rest of you 
get some kip while you can. Once 
we're done with our tea I'll be 
introducing our newest member to 
the delights of shovelling coal.
Bosun, Corky and Weasel head below deck.
EXT. CHARON COCKPIT - NIGHT
Josephine and Stoker sit in silence, watching the river.
JOSEPHINE
Corky doesn't say much does he?
STOKER
No I don't suppose he does. 
(a sip of tea)
You should know Gunner was a good 
man. As much of any of us can be.
JOSEPHINE
The only thing he left me was debt.
STOKER
Well I'd wager this boat that his 
debt is not the reason you are 
here.
JOSEPHINE
Then you'd be walking the rest of 
the way.
Stoker chuckles and then frowns.
Another set of lights appear in the distance ON THE CANAL.
JOSEPHINE (CONT’D)
More trouble?
Stoker peers at the lights.
STOKER
Not sure yet.
The lights get brighter. Stoker picks up Bosun's rifle and 
places it next to him, leaning it against the cabin.
Josephine puts down her tea and reaches for the boat hook. 
She goes to lift it but Stoker puts his foot in the way.
STOKER (CONT’D)
Don't want them to think we want a 
altercation. We only want to be 
ready should one happen."
"31.
The lights on the other boat draw closer and closer.
STOKER (CONT’D)
On your feet, Joe.
Stoker and Joe rise up, not at attention but ready.
Josephine looks from the approaching lights to Stoker's face.
The approaching lights illuminate the entire river. We see 
the outline of narrow boat behind them.
The boat is larger than the Charon. Dark. Serious.
We see a crew of half a dozen on board, they all have weapons 
in their hands. Not ready to attack, ready to react.
As the two boats pass both crews are frozen, ready to for 
combat. Neither trusting the other.  
Then they part again. The world is darker now the lights are 
pointed the other way.
Stoker sighs with relief and tucks Bosun's rifle away. 
STOKER (CONT’D)
Peculiar thing is, Gunner and I 
worked together for years. On long 
shifts at night like this you talk 
about kin and the such to pass the 
hours. He never mentioned a son.
Stoker lights his pipe and looks out over the dark fields.
EXT. RAINY CANAL - NIGHT
The Charon motors through the night. In the distance the 
lights of a town get slowly further away.
EXT. GYPSY CAMP - NIGHT
We see smoke coming out of the top of a Vardo (a traditional 
Romani wagon) at the side of the road. Heavy horses are 
tethered nearby, nibbling at the grass. 
Two people are outside, lit by a fire. MANFRI, 40s, all sinew 
with long dark hair and a neat beard. LASH, 40s, short with a 
shaved head.
ROSELLA, 10, dark hair, watches from inside the Vardo.
Manfri drags a box out of the Vardo. It lands with a clatter.
LASH
You don't even know what's in 
there. "
"32.
Manfri pulls out something from the box. Unwrapping it 
carefully, a punch dagger. He tucks the dagger away and 
searches through the box.
LASH (CONT’D)
You'd risk our blood on your 
dreams.
Lash stands closer, trying to get his attention.
LASH (CONT’D)
And the crew? They aren't going to 
give it up. Does every river need 
to run red?
Manfri pauses, sitting back on his heels.
MANFRI
I don't recall you pleading for 
mercy for the Lock Keeper, and his 
family.
A pause, heavy with a grim secret.
LASH
Not all sins can be forgiven.
Manfri nods, and then resumes his search.
MANFRI
The innocent don't work for Bill 
Lyle.
Manfri opens a fancy carved case. Inside is a bronze SWORD.
LASH
That's my point and we don't take 
from him. We leave him alone, he 
leaves us alone.
Manfri tests the blade of the sword - it's terrifyingly sharp 
- and carefully places it in a scabbard. He stands.
MANFRI
Are you coming or do we have to 
wait till your tongue has got 
tired?
Lash pulls out a pistol and checks it's loaded.
MANFRI (CONT’D)
Get the horses ready.
Lash leaves. Rosella runs over and hugs Manfri's waist.
MANFRI (CONT’D)
What's this, have you turned into 
an owl?"
"33.
ROSELLA
I heard talking.
She buries her head in his shirt.
MANFRI
That was not for young ears.
ROSELLA
There's no honey in a wasps nest, 
that's what you said for me.
Manfri snorts with amusement.
MANFRI
Don't worry, I'll be back before 
the crows.
Manfri whistles. A half dozen Romani men dressed in ragged, 
black and white clothes - like we saw at the Lock - walk into 
the firelight.
INT. CHARON ENGINE ROOM - EARLY MORNING.
The steam engine is a mass of dials and pipes in the middle 
of a cramped room. A few bags of coal wait by the engine.
Corky's feet poke out of a tiny bed at the rear of the room.
The Steam engine rumbles and thuds as it works. Josephine 
stands in front of it, holding a shovel.
Stoker is outside, shaving with a razor as he talks. Every 
few moments he leans through the hatch into the engine room.
Josephine chucks in a couple of shovels of coal.
STOKER
A natural. Remember, three rings on 
the bell. Stop the engine as fast 
as you can.
Josephine touches a dial and speaks like she's reciting 
something she's had drilled into her.
JOSEPHINE
I twist this, then this one and 
finally this one, but slowly like 
you can't afford to break it. Yank 
it and the engine will jam. We'll 
be dead in the water.
STOKER
Now you've mastered it. Get the 
kettle on. I'm gasping."
"34.
Stoker pulls himself upright, empties the dish he was using 
to shave into the river and he folds his razor away.
Josephine puts a brass kettle on a corner of the steam 
engine. She rubs one of the dials with a cloth and allows 
herself a small smile. She might even be enjoying herself.
Movement from outside catches Josephine's eye. She leans out 
of the window.
EXT. CHARON COCKPIT - EARLY MORNING
Stoker leans on the tiller, enjoying the early morning sun on 
his face and cleaning out his pipe. 
He pats his pockets, pulls out a pouch of tobacco but it's 
empty. His shoulders sink at the denial of a simple pleasure.
Bosun appears from below deck, he takes Stoker's pipe and 
fills it with his own tobacco. As he hands it back their 
hands touch for a few heartbeats longer than required. A 
tender moment.
Josephine's eyes bulge with surprise and she flinches back 
inside the Engine room, hitting the frame on the way in. 
Stoker and Bosun look up at the noise.
INT. CHARON ENGINE ROOM - EARLY MORNING
Josephine stares, unsure what to think. Part of her is 
disgusted.
The bell rings once. It takes Josephine a few blinks to 
realise what that means. 
She yanks a lever, then another. As she is about to move the 
third lever Corky appears, and slows her hand with his own.
He watches the dials on the engine carefully. 
JOSEPHINE
Did I do it right?
He checks over the engine, and even opens the fire grate for 
good measure. A grin and a nod. You did okay.
JOSEPHINE (CONT’D)
Thank you.
Bosun appears through the hatch. 
BOSUN
Stoker's stopping us at Old Sal's. 
Pick up some more coal, and if we 
are lucky a couple of her pies.
(MORE)"
"35.
BOSUN (CONT’D)
Gives you a chance to stretch your 
legs.
EXT. OLD SAL'S CANAL SIDE - EARLY MORNING
A PAIR OF CARTS are pulled up alongside the water.
One piled high with coal the other full of all the sorts of 
things people on the canal might need. Food, rope, bottles of 
drink. An itinerant trading station.
OLD SAL, 70s, long white hair, simple clothes, sensible 
boots, sits on a chair. A couple of men unload sacks of coal 
onto the canal side.
The Charon eases out of the centre of the canal towards the 
wagons. Josephine emerges from the engine room.
Stoker at the tiller shouts while smiling the whole time.
STOKER
Bestill my beating heart, is this a 
siren by the shore?  Bewitching 
sailors with her beauty and luring 
them astray.
Old Sal cracks a grin. Bosun rolls his eyes at Josephine, 
with a hint of a smile.
OLD SAL
Stoker! You swarthy Lothario. You 
may try but you won't be tempting 
my innocence today.
Bosun leans towards Josephine.
BOSUN
They do this every bloody time. It 
can go on for hours.
The Charon bumps gently against the side of the canal. Bosun 
hops off and ties it up. 
Stoker climbs off the boat and saunters up to Old Sal.
STOKER
You're saying there is hope for 
tomorrow?
He kisses Old Sal's hand. She feigns blushing.
OLD SAL
There is always hope tomorrow. What 
do you need?"
"36.
STOKER
A flask or two of lamp oil, a half 
dozen pies and every bit of coal we 
can carry.
OLD SAL
Going far?
Weasel scowls at Stoker. Don't say anything.
STOKER
A single step away from you would 
be too many.
Old Sal grins and turns to the two men by the wagons.
OLD SAL
Go on then, get loading.
The men begin hauling bags of coal over to the side of the 
Charon. Bosun and Corky load them below deck. 
OLD SAL (CONT’D)
I see you've got a new one on 
board.
Stoker turns to Josephine.
STOKER
Only temporary.
OLD SAL
Gunner's child?
STOKER
You can tell?
OLD SAL
Not got his size, but got his eyes 
all right.
She raises a finger to Josephine. Come here. Josephine 
doesn't rush.
Old Sal sizes her up. She puts down a deck of tarot cards. We 
see the Seven of Swords on the top - the card of lies.
Stoker sees Bosun talking to one of the nephews. He hands one 
of them a LETTER. 
STOKER
I best help the lads with the coal. 
Mr Weasel here will pay you.
He walks towards Bosun."
"37.
STOKER (CONT’D)
And don't be scaring the child with 
the future.
Weasel looks over from the back of the Charon.
WEASEL
Where is the liquor?
Old Sal nods, and points to the wagon full of supplies. 
Weasel stands up and walks over. 
OLD SAL
Let's see your fortune shall we? 
Which hand do you favour?
Josephine slowly holds out her left hand. Old Sal reaches 
past and grabs her right hand.
OLD SAL (CONT’D)
This is what you start with. 
She turns the hand peering at it.
OLD SAL (CONT’D)
Strong heart, foolish head. You 
were born into love though. Most 
aren't so lucky.
She takes Josephine's other hand.
OLD SAL (CONT’D)
And now for your fortune. Do you 
want the good news, or the truth?
Josephine looks at her.
JOSEPHINE
Can't I have both?
A chuckle from Old Sal
OLD SAL
You might end up with none.
JOSEPHINE
I'll take the truth then.
OLD SAL
The right choice. Always the right 
choice. You can brace for bad news. 
Daydreams of good are no-use to 
anyone. Mr Weasel you'll pay for 
everything you open, thank you.
Behind Old Sal, Weasel stops moving with a bottle of 
something at his lips."
"38.
WEASEL
I need to sample it first.
She turns to face him.
OLD SAL
You taste it then you're buying it.
WEASEL
Fine.
He takes a swig. It's disgusting.
WEASEL (CONT’D)
(under his breath)
Bosun can have that one.
He tucks the bottle under his arm and reaches for another. 
Old Sal squints at Josephine's hand, flexing it to make the 
lines show up.
OLD SAL
Now, where were we? Yes, yes. Lies 
got you here. Fast fingers too. Why 
I'd bet you'd pick the devil's 
pocket given half a chance.
Panic on Josephine's face. She tries to pull her hand away, 
but Old Sal's grip is a vice.
OLD SAL (CONT’D)
Lies upon lies, but a few more and 
a bit of confidence could carry you 
out of here as well.
She nods towards the crew.
OLD SAL (CONT’D)
Most of them don't realise your 
deception yet, but they will.
Josephine looks over at the Charon, then back at Sal.
JOSEPHINE
What difference does it make if I 
curtsy or bow?
Old Sal snorts.
OLD SAL
Oh come now. We both know that is 
not the trickery we are talking 
about.
(A warm smile)
Why sully this friendship?
They lock eyes."
"39.
JOSEPHINE
Who said we are friends?
OLD SAL
Might be in the future.
She turns Josephine's hand over, looking at the edges.
OLD SAL (CONT’D)
You've got a choice coming. Just 
when you think all is lost, you'll 
get a chance to risk even more. 
Old Sal looks up at Josephine's face. Something in 
Josephine's expression catches Old Sal off guard.
Stoker is suddenly next to them.
STOKER
You got any of that gooseberry jam? 
Old Sal lets go of Josephine's hand and smiles at Stoker.
OLD SAL
Your sweet tooth will be the death 
of you, Mr Stoker.
STOKER
Sounds like a lovely way to go.
Old Sal grins at him. There is real affection there.
Weasel interrupts, laden with bottles of booze. 
WEASEL
What do I owe you?
He loads Josephine's arms with the bottles and pulls out a 
long leather wallet. The drink has improved his mood.
WEASEL (CONT’D)
Don't you drop any of those bottles 
and ruin my good spirits.
Weasel laughs at his own pun. No one else joins in.
Josephine staggers over to the Charon leaving Weasel and 
Stoker to bargain with Old Sal.
Bosun takes a bottle, pulls the cork out with his teeth and 
takes a gulp. It's disgusting, but Bosun is pleased by that.
BOSUN
Old Sal been filling your head with 
bollocks?
JOSEPHINE
She told my fortune."
"40.
BOSUN
Did she tell you to listen to 
strangers in petticoats less? 
Especially ones that lurk around 
the water's edge?
He takes another swig and then offers the bottle to her. 
Josephine puts the rest of the bottles down carefully.
She rubs the end of the bottle with the corner of her shirt 
and takes a swig.
Bosun is impressed that she doesn't cough. 
JOSEPHINE
It's okay. Bit watery.
She splutters.
Corky joins them. He's also out of breath and covered in coal 
dust. Josephine offers the bottle to him. 
He nods thanks and drinks. They watch Weasel and Stoker 
squabble over supplies.
BOSUN
It's said she knows the old ways, 
magic and such. Mostly she tells 
people what she thinks they need to 
know. 
Bosun takes a swig of the bottle.
JOSEPHINE
What did she tell you?
BOSUN
That doing the right thing would 
kill me. 
(Another swig of booze)
So I've got a few years in me yet.
Corky and Bosun share a grin.
STOKER
If you fancy ladies have finished 
with high tea, we have work to do.
Corky shuffles down the boat towards his station. Bosun gets 
off the boat and unties it from the dock.
Weasel climbs on board muttering to himself. Stoker rings the 
bell twice. The steam engine at the front of the boat speeds 
up, dragging the Charon forward."
"41.
EXT. TUNNEL ENTRANCE - DAY
The canal leads into a long, dark tunnel. The tunnel so long 
the light at the end is a tiny circle.
Deacon steps down into view and onto the canal path. He peers 
down into the tunnel. After gazing into it for a moment he 
signals with his hand.
A dozen large men step down into sight on both sides of the 
canal. They are armed with an array of nasty weapons, bill 
hooks, cleavers, a couple of ancient looking guns.
They settle down, ready for a long wait. Deacon smiles to 
himself.
EXT. CHARON PROW - DAY
Josephine, armed with the boat hook, stands on the prow. 
Watching the waters carefully.
Beside her Corky plays a slow tune on a patch-work fiddle.
Stoker approaches. Nursing an old injury in his leg.
STOKER
We could be on a boat of the dead, 
on the way to hell for the devil 
himself and still some fool would 
make it worse bringing a damn 
fiddle.
Corky looks hurt and lowers his bow.
STOKER (CONT’D)
I didn't say stop did I?
Corky grins and resumes playing. We get the feeling this 
exact conversation has happened more than once.
Stoker sits on the front of the cabin, pulls out his pipe.
STOKER (CONT’D)
Keep your elbow up, you want to 
stay loose. Then strike. That's it.
Josephine stabs at the water, pulls out bit of flotsam and 
throws it aside.
JOSEPHINE
What's he like?
She angrily stabs at the water with the boat hook. Catching 
nothing but a splash."
"42.
STOKER
Bosun, a little to starboard if you 
would. Water looks a touch shallow 
for my tastes.
Bosun nods. The boat shifts over. Stoker resumes smoking. 
Josephine fumes for a while, and then speaks softly
STOKER (CONT’D)
Who?
JOSEPHINE
Bill Lyle.
STOKER
That's a question that's best left 
unasked. 
JOSEPHINE
But I am asking.
STOKER
Well, I've never seen the cloven 
hooves myself.
Stoker smiles.
JOSEPHINE
He's only a man. Same as any other.
STOKER
Same as any other with means. Has a 
way of making people do things they 
wouldn't normally consider.
JOSEPHINE
Like my father?
Stoker lowers his pipe.
STOKER
Gunner signed up because he had 
obligations. Burdens that couldn't 
be met any other way.
Stoker looks at Josephine. It is clear whose fault that is. 
JOSEPHINE
It ain’t right for one man to have 
power over so many.
Weasel appears, clutching a bottle, eyeing them up.
WEASEL
Curious are you, boy? Want to know 
what your saintly father did?"
"43.
Corky stops playing the fiddle and disappears back into the 
cabin. He wants no part of this.
JOSEPHINE
I've a right haven't I?
WEASEL
How do you figure that?
JOSEPHINE
It's why I'm here. And why are you 
here Mr Weasel? I'm guessing it's 
not for the company.
WEASEL
That's between me and Mr Lyle and 
his ledger. You'll understand soon 
enough that we all have a place in 
this world. There's an order. Mr 
Lyle at the top, me just below him 
and you at the bottom.
Josephine laughs.
JOSEPHINE
So we all have a boot on our necks, 
it's just your one has fancy laces?
Weasel pushes his coat back and rests his hand on his pistol, 
daring Josephine to say more.
STOKER
Murder.
Stoker turns to Josephine and sighs before speaking.
STOKER (CONT’D)
Murder is how I ended up here. 
Killed someone I shouldn't have. 
Corky said something unwise, and 
wouldn't stop when he was told. Mr 
Lyle took his tongue, and then 
charged him for it. Bosun.
Stoker glances down the boat at Bosun.
STOKER (CONT’D)
Well he lived a life that people 
would have you judge poorly.  
Tucked away he has a coat covered 
in medals from the Admiralty, 
didn't help him none.
Stoker looks away for a moment.
STOKER (CONT’D)
What I'm saying is, you are better 
off not knowing. Leave it."
"44.
Weasel takes his hand away from his pistol.
WEASEL
Keep the gossiping of your crew 
under control, Stoker. I won't 
remind you again.
Stoker avoids making eye contact with Weasel.
STOKER
Very good, Mr Weasel.
Weasel works his way down the boat. He tips the bottle into 
his mouth. It's empty. He's disgusted and throws the bottle 
into the water.
STOKER (CONT’D)
Don't you mind him, he's stewing 
because he knows they are going to 
come for the cargo we carry.
JOSEPHINE
Who?
STOKER
It doesn't matter. It all ends the 
same way.
EXT. MUDDY CANAL - DAY
The Charon cuts through a canal covered in duckweeds.
A pair of tiny children, barely clothed, sift through the 
dark mud on the edge of the canal looking for things to eat.
They look up to see Josephine on prow of Charon and run away.
INT. CHARON ENGINE ROOM - NIGHT
Bosun works the engine carefully. Corky sleeps behind him.
He leans, out of the hatch. Enjoying the breeze on his face. 
Bosun smiles at Stoker and then his eyes land on the cargo. A 
pause.
Bosun looks around and then reaches behind the engine and 
hits something with a hammer. 
The noise of the engine changes. It begins to rattle. Corky 
stirs, and then falls back asleep.
The rattling gets worse, something is broken.
Bosun shovels another load of coal in the engine."
"45.
EXT. AQUEDUCT - DAWN
A huge iron and brick aqueduct looms high above a valley. We 
see the Charon crossing it. 
Josephine holds onto the cabin of the Charon as she leans 
over the side, looking down into the valley below.
She sees a rabbit in the field below, stretching out. 
Enjoying the sun.
A peregrine falcon drops out of the sky. 
The rabbit screams like a child as the bird eats it.
INT. CHARON ENGINE ROOM - DAY
Corky stands in front of the steam engine. The engine shakes 
and rattles as it works away.
We see a dial, the needle is drifting towards a red area. 
Corky frowns and adjusts a lever. 
The dial continues to creep up.
He opens a valve briefly, steam shoots out. When it clears he  
rubs condensation off the dial and peers at it. 
It's still moving towards the red.
Corky reaches over to the rope with the bell on. He pulls at 
it again and again. Causing the bell in the cockpit to sing.
Bosun appears.
BOSUN
What's up, Corky?
Corky points to the dial. Bosun lowers his head inside to get 
a better look at it. He doesn't like what he sees.
BOSUN (CONT’D)
You tried venting?
Corky nods.
BOSUN (CONT’D)
What about...
Bosun taps the dial, the needle moves a towards the red area.
BOSUN (CONT’D)
Okay, run it faster. Maybe we can 
work off a bit of the pressure?
Corky folds his arms. I won't."
"46.
BOSUN (CONT’D)
Do you have a better plan?
Corky points to a bucket of water and then at the fire.
BOSUN (CONT’D)
I'll ask Stoker, but I doubt it. In 
the meantime we have to run her 
faster.
He reaches forward to grab a wheel. Corky stops him, and 
turns the wheel himself, incredibly slowly.
The steam engine picks up pace, but shakes violently.
EXT. CHARON BOW - DAY
Josephine stands on the prow of the boat. Watching the water. 
Stoker sits nearby, shaving with his razor.
Josephine lunges with the hook, when she pulls it out she's 
stabbed a FISH with it. She beams with pride.
STOKER
With a bit more practice you might 
yet be more of a danger to others 
than yourself.
Bosun appears out of the hatch and shuffles towards the prow. 
Stoker speaks without taking his eyes off Josephine.
STOKER (CONT’D)
Quite a pace you have us running 
there, Bosun.
BOSUN
Regulator's gone. She's not 
venting.
Stoker steps away from Josephine and turns towards Bosun.
BOSUN (CONT’D)
The extra speed should bleed off 
pressure but...
STOKER
How long can we keep her running?
BOSUN
If the engine doesn't shake itself 
to pieces? A day, maybe less? 
Either way we need someone who 
actually knows what they are doing 
manning it at all times. Sorry, 
Joe."
"47.
JOSEPHINE
I didn't like shovelling anyway.
STOKER
Can you hold her together long 
enough to nurse us through the 
tunnel?
Bosun pokes his head in through the hatch leading to the 
engine room. Watching the engine for a moment. Then he stands 
up again, muttering to himself as he calculates.
BOSUN
Could we stop at sundown? Let her 
cool off?
Stoker shakes his head.
STOKER
(Interrupting)
Our quill-driver over there 
wouldn't allow it, and I'm 
disappointed to be in agreement 
with him.
Bosun shakes his head. He looks back towards the crate.
BOSUN
We'll all be disappointed if the 
engine blows and what's in that 
crate gets out.
He thinks for a moment as though his next thought has just 
come to him.
BOSUN (CONT’D)
Blundell's ain't far from here.
STOKER
We're not on the best of terms.
JOSEPHINE
What does that mean?
STOKER
He's as likely to pull a gun as he 
is to help me.
BOSUN
Vexation or not Blundell has tools, 
spares and machinists.
Stoker looks towards the engine room, then down the canal.
STOKER
We can't risk it.
Bosun touches his arm - You have to."
"48.
STOKER (CONT’D)
(Irish)
Dia ár sábháil
He nods at Bosun. Bosun immediately shuffles down the boat 
and takes over the tiller from Weasel.
Josephine looks uncomfortable. 
STOKER (CONT’D)
You not an admirer of Blundell 
either?
JOSEPHINE
I'm not an admirer of living in 
sin.
Stoker chuckles and loads his pipe as he talks. Each move is 
measured and considered.
STOKER
I don't know if you've earned the 
privilege of morals.
JOSEPHINE
I know what's wrong.
STOKER
We all have the right to our 
secrets, I'm sure you agree with 
that. How else will we secure an 
understanding...
He tampers down his pipe.
STOKER (CONT’D)
...About how the facts our of 
respective clandestine particulars 
are best kept between the few.
They watch each other carefully.
EXT. CHARON COCKPIT - DAY
Stoker holds the tiller. Weasel stands close to him, his face 
almost touching. 
WEASEL
WE DO NOT HAVE TIME FOR THIS.
Spittle flies from Weasel's mouth.
STOKER
You can scream that at the engine 
if you want, Mr Weasel. We've all 
taken our turn."
"49.
WEASEL
Why can't you fix it? I thought you 
were an expert boatsman? No one 
knows the canals like Stoker, got 
coal in his veins, born on the 
water, that's what I was told.
STOKER
Does that fancy waistcoat of yours 
secretly have a lathe in it? 
Perhaps a pillar drill or two?
Weasel frowns.
WEASEL
Of course not.
STOKER
Then we need to go to a proper 
workshop.
Bosun shuffles down towards the cockpit.
WEASEL
We can't be late. Not for Mr Lyle. 
He won't stand for it.
STOKER
Our options are maybe late. Or if 
the engine blows, not at all. Which 
would you prefer?
Weasel folds his arms. Scowling.
BOSUN
And Blundell's has a pub.
Weasel licks his lips.
WEASEL
Better the devil you know I 
suppose.
EXT. BLUNDELL'S SHIPYARD - DAY
The Charon splutters towards the shore.
A sturdy red brick building commands the side of the canal 
amongst the trees. A wooden winch stands proudly outside. 
Sacks of coal and crates are stacked up outside the building. 
Men lug them to or from the waiting boats, pausing only to 
swig from pewter mugs on tables outside.
A half dozen canal boats are moored up nearby, in various 
states of repair. More men work on them."
"50.
EXT. CHARON COCKPIT - DAY
Bosun leaps off the silent boat and ties it up. 
STOKER
Let's hope the machinist hasn't 
been at the ale yet. Come on, 
Corky.
Stoker and Corky climb off the boat, Stoker faces Bosun.
BOSUN
I should come with you, Blundell 
likes me.
STOKER
Fallen for your legendary charm has 
he?
WEASEL
A proper drink and the chance of 
some intelligent conversation will 
do much to renew my vigour.
Weasel straightens his collar and brushes down his clothes 
with his hands, and steps off the boat.
STOKER
What will Mr Lyle say if he finds 
out you left the cargo?
WEASEL
What about Joe?
They all turn to Josephine, sitting on the cabin. She stands 
to attention. Weasel looks at her, and finds her lacking.
He climbs back on board.
WEASEL (CONT’D)
Bring me whiskey, proper stuff. 
None of the Irish slop.
Stoker gestures to Bosun.
STOKER
Come on then, Bosun, Corky with me. 
INT. BLUNDELL'S - DAY
The room is dark. Wooden furniture, soot-stained walls. 
A couple of men in sweaty shirts stand by the bar. Another 
snoozes by the door, eyes hidden under a flat cap.
All is quiet apart from the occasional cough or snore."
"51.
Behind the bar is BLUNDELL, 40s, heavy-set with a drooping 
moustache, a sharp centre parting and a mottled, sagging 
vest. One eye is covered with a patch. 
He polishes a mug with a filthy rag.
Stoker pushes the door open, followed by Bosun and Corky. 
Bosun glances around. He's on edge.
Blundell squints at them. He doesn't like what he sees.
BLUNDELL
Bold of you to be parading around 
here, Stoker.
The patrons turn to watch as Stoker lurches over and slams 
coins on on the bar.
STOKER
Got a handful of apologies here for 
you.
Blundell picks a coin up and bites it. It's legitimate. Not 
what he expected. Blundell picks up a pint mug.
BLUNDELL
What will it be?
Stoker places both hands on the bar, one right by the coins.
STOKER
I need your machinist, now.
BLUNDELL
Then you'll need a drink, he's 
booked up for the next week. 
STOKER
What if I pay extra?
BLUNDELL
You're already paying over the odds 
on account of last time, but it 
makes no difference. He's busy.
They glare at each other.
STOKER
Working for who?
BLUNDELL
It's whom, but what's it to you?
STOKER
Maybe a little silver might 
persuade them their need is less 
urgent than mine."
"52.
BLUNDELL
Despite what you believe, the 
entire world doesn't march to your 
drum, Stoker.
Eyes narrow. Stoker turns to Corky.
STOKER
You might as well head back to the 
boat. It appears Mr Blundell still 
has an appetite for bartering.
Corky nods and leaves, the door bangs as it shuts. One of the 
men at the bar twitches a hand towards his pocket.
BLUNDELL
Well that's adjusted the terms of 
our negotiation.
Stoker turns back. Blundell has a gun pressed to Stoker's 
forehead.
BLUNDELL (CONT’D)
This doesn't have to end in blood.
EXT. CHARON COCKPIT - DAY
Josephine sits by the tiller watching Blundell's. Weasel 
follows her gaze and then looks at her. Deciding something.
WEASEL
Awful brave of you.
JOSEPHINE
Brave?
WEASEL
Going on a boat with a bunch of 
swarthy strangers, men and such.
Josephine looks at him - what do you want?
WEASEL (CONT’D)
Not many would have done what you 
did. Specially not a young...
(licks his lips)
Girl like yourself.
Josephine stops moving. 
WEASEL (CONT’D)
Oh, I'm sure the rest of the crew 
haven't noticed. Simple folk, but I 
- well - I am cursed to discern 
things most others miss."
"53.
JOSEPHINE
The drink has addled your mind.
WEASEL
How dare you. 
(I'm trying to help you)
I mention it because I've heard 
stories. Of other women who tried 
to live in a man's world. Got found 
out. And the crew, the crew were 
ungentlemanly to them...
JOSEPHINE
I can look after myself.
Weasel walks over to Josephine. Standing a little too close 
to her. 
WEASEL
What you need is a protector, 
someone to look after you. This is 
no life for a girl.
JOSEPHINE
What are you suggesting?
WEASEL
Well, I'm saying if you were to 
say, perform certain duties for me, 
I could put in a word with Mr Lyle.
Weasel steps so his crotch is level with Josephine's face.
WEASEL (CONT’D)
There's more than one way to settle 
a debt.
Josephine stands, taking hold of the lapels of Weasels frayed 
waistcoat, pulling him closer.
JOSEPHINE
Do you have duties in mind?
WEASEL
Nothing too onerous, you might in 
time find yourself enjoying them.
Weasel grins revealing a mouth of yellow teeth. Josephine 
pushes him away. He stumbles.
WEASEL (CONT’D)
Watch yourself. It wouldn't take 
much for a man to press himself 
upon you and then what would you 
do?
JOSEPHINE
Stop him."
"54.
WEASEL
And if he had a knife pressed 
against your throat or gun to your 
sweetbreads?
Josephine's eyes are cold.
JOSEPHINE
Then I'd have a choice. Shoot him 
or gut him.
Weasel frowns.
WEASEL
You have neither gun nor blade.
She pulls out Weasel's pistol, and his crude flick knife. 
Weasel's eyes go wide. He pats his pockets, they are empty.
WEASEL (CONT’D)
You dirty thief. Give those back.
Josephine gives Weasel a pitiful look and tosses the knife 
and pistol at his feet. He scoops them up, all the while 
watching her.
The weight of the pistol in his hand soothes him. He tilts 
his head. Back in control. 
He points the gun near Josephine.
WEASEL (CONT’D)
You owe me an apology.
JOSEPHINE
Fetch me a sandwich.
WEASEL
What?
JOSEPHINE
All this yabbling has made me 
hungry. Go to Blundell's bring me 
food.
Weasel points the gun directly at Josephine.
WEASEL
I don't care for your tone.
JOSEPHINE
And a drink, something to quench my 
thirst.
Weasel lifts the guns until it's pointing directly at 
Josephine's head. He clicks back the hammer."
"55.
WEASEL
You better start being nice to me, 
girl.
Josephine blinks slowly.
JOSEPHINE
I'm no expert, but don't you need 
these?
She opens her hand, we see six bullets inside.
WEASEL
Bloody witch. Get off my boat.
Josephine flinches towards Weasel, like she's about to hit 
him. He backs away, almost falling off the Charon. 
She climbs off the boat and heads towards Blundell's. We see 
her drop the bullets on the floor as she walks.
Weasel jumps off the boat and scrambles in the dirt after the 
bullets. He climbs back onboard, looking spooked.
INT. BLUNDELL'S - DAY
Stoker looks down the barrel of the gun pointed at his 
forehead.
STOKER
A man could take offense - finding 
so much iron pointed at him.
BLUNDELL
All you have to do is stay in here, 
enjoy a drink. And when you leave. 
Be on your way without...It.
STOKER
You know we can't do that.
Stoker and Blundell eyeball each other.
STOKER (CONT’D)
This is where we need some of your 
charm, Bosun.
BLUNDELL
Don't you worry, Bosun already has 
me convinced.
Stoker frowns.
BLUNDELL (CONT’D)
There was a letter. Explained what 
what was at stake."
"56.
BOSUN
I'm sorry, Stoker.
The men at the bar pull out pistols, pointed at Stoker. By 
the door, the previously sleeping man snaps awake and has a 
shotgun in his hands.
Stoker ignores it all, only looking at Bosun. He can't 
believe what is happening.
EXT. BLUNDELL'S SHIPYARD - DAY
Corky watches with confusion on his face as Josephine walks 
towards him. He tries to get her attention. She ignores him.
He reaches out a hand to stop her. She pushes it away and 
stomps past.
As he turns to watch her, he notices armed men crouching 
behind a beached canal boat.
He breaks into a sprint towards the Charon.
INT. BLUNDELL'S - DAY
Stoker looks at Bosun his mind racing has he tries to spot 
what he has missed.
STOKER
What have you done? 
Blundell takes half a step back, alarmed at the rage coming 
off Stoker like steam.
BLUNDELL
We just want the cargo. Nothing 
more.
The men at the bar holding guns glance at Blundell - what 
should we do now? 
BOSUN
You saw what it did to Yeoman's 
eyes.
STOKER
Yeoman was looking where he 
shouldn't have been.
BLUNDELL
Eyes?
Bosun and Stoker only look at each other. It's as if the 
other people, and the guns they are holding have disappeared."
"57.
BOSUN
It's too dangerous.
STOKER
We take precautions. We're 
professionals.
BOSUN
We can't, Stoker, we can't let him 
have it.
Stoker bangs his hands on the bar, causing the coins to 
rattle and everyone to flinch. The man with the shotgun by 
the door nearly drops it.
The other two men with their pistols pointed at Bosun and 
Stoker don't fare much better.
STOKER
We took the job, signed our marks.
Stoker turns to face Bosun. One hand is curled into a fist.
STOKER (CONT’D)
Keep our heads down. Do the work. 
That's what we agreed.
BLUNDELL
What's in the crate?
BOSUN
That worked before, but look what 
happened to Yeoman, and Gunner. I 
can't let that happen again.
STOKER
What do you think will happen to us 
if we betray, him? You can't scrub 
a lifetime of sin away with one 
act. We're damned.
BOSUN
I have to try.
Stoker knows he does, in his heart.
STOKER
I'm sorry this won't go as you 
hoped.
Bosun nods slowly.
BOSUN
All we need to do is stay here.
Stoker shakes his head. His eyes sparkle, could those be 
tears?"
"58.
STOKER
I'll miss you.
There is a twitch of something on Bosun's face.
BOSUN
And I you.
Stoker throws the coins in his fist at the face of the man 
behind him. The man raises a hand to protect his face.
Stoker lunges forward, grabs the pistol from the man, shoots 
him and then shoots the man BEHIND Bosun.
They drop to the floor dead.
Bosun picks up the gun from the dead man and turns towards 
Stoker. 
They watch each other carefully. What now?
The DOOR BANGS OPEN as Josephine arrives. 
The surprise causes the man by the door to fire his shotgun 
at Stoker. He misses. 
Stoker returns fire, killing the man by the door with a 
single bullet.
Blundell aims towards Stoker.
BOSUN (CONT’D)
Stoker!
Bosun fires at Blundell. Bang. Hits him in the side of the 
chest.
Blundell spins from the impact of the bullet. As he falls, he 
fires towards Bosun. Bang. Bang.
For a moment the pub is quiet then we hear gunshots from 
outside. Josephine turns to see what's happening.
Bosun sinks to his knees. Red blooming across his chest.
EXT. CHARON - DAY
Corky and Weasel crouch in the cockpit of the Charon. Corky 
pops up and fires the rifle. Weasel fires his revolver.
The people on the shore return fire. Corky ducks down.
WEASEL
(Shouting to shore)
You fools. You hit that crate we're 
all dead!"
"59.
He has to duck away as bullets fly past his head.
A stray shot HITS THE TETHER HOLDING THE CRATE TO THE BOAT.
The tether snaps. The Crate slides across the deck, pitching 
the Charon violently to one side.
Weasel fires wildly, until his pistol only clicks.
WEASEL (CONT’D)
Cut us loose and get a steam on.
Corky frowns at him.
WEASEL (CONT’D)
I don't care if it might blow. Cut 
us loose!
Corky looks towards the shore, then at the crate. He throws 
the rifle to Weasel.
Weasel sights down the rifle, trying to make these shots 
count.
Corky puts a knife in his teeth and then races down the boat, 
slicing at the moorings.
The Charon shudders as bullets hit it.
Corky slices the last mooring. The Crate slides even further, 
almost tipping the boat over.
Corky pushes off against the dock and ducks. The Charon 
slowly drifts away from the shore.
INT. BLUNDELL'S - DAY
Stoker cradles Bosun in his arms. Josephine is crouching by 
the door looking outside.
BOSUN
Looks like Old Sal was right.
STOKER
This isn't the ending I had planned 
for us.
Bosun lifts an arm to hug him.
BOSUN
It'll do.
Bosun eyes are still. He's dead.
Josephine rushes over to Stoker."
"60.
JOSEPHINE
They're leaving us behind.
She freezes when she sees Stoker carefully lower Bosun to the 
ground. He stands. Wincing as he does.
STOKER
We'll see about that.
EXT. BLUNDELL'S SHIPYARD - DAY
Stoker and Josephine emerge from Blundell's bar. Slowly, 
watching for threats. 
There are bodies everywhere. A couple of boats are on fire.
Stoker hobbles across the towards the workbenches with 
Josephine beside him. He has a shotgun in his hands.
JOSEPHINE
They went that way.
Stoker picks up a wooden tool box and starts throwing tools 
from the bench into it.
STOKER
I know.
A man appears behind Stoker and Josephine, he has a gun 
levelled at them.
MAN WITH GUN
Mr Stoker, as I live and breathe. 
I've waited years to do this.
BANG!
Stoker shoots him. He throws the shotgun to Josephine and 
continues to the tools into the box. 
In the distance we hear DOGS BARKING. Stoker turns to the 
noise. Worry is clear on his face.
STOKER
Come on then.
He hobbles off with Josephine following.
EXT. CHARON - DAY
The boat drifts forward, listing heavily to one side. The 
unbalanced weight causes the boat to turn towards the bank. 
Thick black smoke bellows out of the engine room."
"61.
Corky is on the tiller, fighting against it. Weasel is behind 
the cabin. Shooting toward the shore.
Bullets fly over their heads as the last of Blundell's men 
fires at them.
Weasel returns fire with his pistol. Misses with every shot.
At the front of the boat, the steam engine clatters, and 
bangs.
Corky holds the tiller with his foot, pulls out the rifle and 
takes a shot. BANG. He hits. Fight over.
Weasel cheers and then wobbles on his feet as the Charon hits 
the canal side with a crash.
The crate groans as it hits the gunwale. Weasel yelps. They 
both look at the crate like it's about to explode.
EXT. ENTRANCE TO BLUNDELL'S - DAY
We see LLOYD, tall, clean shaven, 20s, slicked back hair, 
khaki clothes. Lloyd fights to control a gigantic dog.
It's got the scent. Lloyd lets go of the collar.
The dog races into the woods. The hunt is on.
EXT. WOODY CANAL PATH - DAY
Tall trees hang over the canal, almost meeting in the middle
Stoker and Josephine run along the water's edge. Stoker's 
limp is slowing them down and clearly causing him great pain. 
With every step the toolbox smashes into his knee. Josephine 
throws the shotgun into the canal and takes the toolbox off 
Stoker.
JOSEPHINE
You're not going to fix the engine 
with a gun anyway.
With the toolbox in one hand, Josephine throws Stoker's arm 
over her shoulder and helps him move.
EXT. CANAL PATH - DAY
Lloyd's dog froths at the mouth with excitement. Racing 
through the undergrowth.
Lloyd pulls out a machete and chases after the dog."
"62.
EXT. WOODY CANAL PATH - DAY
In the distance we can see Charon. 
JOSEPHINE
Corky!
On the boat we see Corky turn his head.
Stoker stumbles. Josephine rushes over and helps him up.
They set off again but Stoker struggles with the pace. Too 
much pain. 
Josephine gets under his arm and helping take some of the 
weight off his leg. 
Behind them sound of barking carries over the water.
EXT. CHARON COCKPIT - DAY
Corky is on the tiller. He peers into the undergrowth trying 
to see what the noise is, something is moving through the 
trees.
He frowns, he spots Josephine waving at him. Corky smashes 
into the tiller, forcing the Charon towards the bank.
EXT. CANAL PATH - DAY
The large dog leaps over a stile and onto the path.
In the distance we see Stoker and Josephine.
EXT. CHARON - DAY
The Charon nears the canal side and SMASHES into the bank, 
knocking Weasel off his feet.
The crate tilts over with the impact, lifting one edge off 
the deck and then slamming it down again.
The boat ricochets off the bank. Corky looks back to 
Josephine. Weasel can't take his eyes off the crate.
EXT. CANAL SIDE - DAY
Stoker and Josephine finally lurch alongside the Charon.
Corky fights against the tiller, but he can't stop the boat 
drifting AWAY from the shore.
Josephine hesitates as the gap between the boat and the shore 
slowly increases."
"63.
The dog barks behind them. It is getting closer.
They jump! Josephine makes the leap cleanly with the tool box 
but Stoker flounders. 
Josephine throws the box inside the boat and grabs Stoker to 
stop him sliding into the water.
The giant dog appears out of the bushes followed by Lloyd, 
with his weapon ready.
He eyes up the jump, but before he can leap, Weasel shuffles 
down the boat and points the pistol right at his head.
WEASEL
Muzzle that hound before I mess up 
your fancy shorts.
Lloyd puts his machete away and grabs the dog by the collar.
WEASEL (CONT’D)
This is my boat, and my crew.
Lloyd backs off. Weasel keeps the gun pointed at him until 
The Charon floats out of sight.
EXT. OLD SAL'S CANAL SIDE - DAY
Old Sal sits by the canal edge. Her tarot cards are in front 
of her. Her two nephews sleep in the shade of the wagons.
Manfri rides up to her on a horse. He asks her a question. 
She shakes her head.
Manfri pulls out his sword. A clear threat.
Old Sal frowns and points down the river.
Another question from Manfri.
Old Sal holds her hand in reply. Three fingers are raised.
Manfri signals to Lash and the other Romani, kicks over the 
table in front of Old Sal and then gallops down the canal 
path.
Old Sal rights the table and picks up the cards. The first 
one in her hand is the Tower. The card of destruction.
EXT. CHARON COCKPIT - DAY
Stoker breathes hard, holding his hand on his hip. Josephine 
flops on the roof of the Charon, barely able to speak because 
she's so out of breath."
"64.
WEASEL
We had to leave. You understand, 
Stoker, the cargo comes first.
Weasel pockets his pistol. He makes a point of not looking at 
Josephine.
WEASEL (CONT’D)
Bosun?
Josephine shakes her head.
WEASEL (CONT’D)
The engine broke on his watch. We 
go to Blundell's on his suggestion 
and every jack-lad there had a 
pocket full of lead that they 
wanted to share.
STOKER
He was a good man, too good for 
this life it turns out.
WEASEL
He turned traitor is what you mean.
JOSEPHINE
He died saving Stoker.
WEASEL
You would take the side of a Judas.
STOKER
He died because he was a fool.
WEASEL
A fool, a traitor and who knows 
what else.
He looks at Stoker. Say something. I dare you.
STOKER
Let me see what I can do about our 
engine.
Stoker stands up, and grabs the toolbox. Josephine watches 
him go, seeing him so diminished is almost unbearable.
EXT. REMOTE CANAL - NIGHT
The Charon drifts helplessly in the water. As it nears a bank 
Josephine uses the boat hook to pushes them away again.
EXT. CHARON COCKPIT - DAWN
The sun rises behind the boat, the sky is an ominous red. "
"65.
Josephine has her hand on the tiller. With a grind the engine 
begins to turn over. Stoker emerges from the engine room.
JOSEPHINE
Is it fixed?
STOKER
There's fixed and there's fixed. 
Stoker sits next to Josephine, and cleans out his pipe. They 
share an awkward silence.
JOSEPHINE
I'm sorry about Bosun. He didn't 
deserve that.
STOKER
I thought you already had him 
damned.
JOSEPHINE
There's nowt that's so broken it 
can't be fixed.
Stoker lights his pipe.
STOKER
There's more forgiveness in that 
than I ever heard from Gunner. 
JOSEPHINE
Mr Lyle has wronged us all.
Josephine sips a mug of tea.
JOSEPHINE (CONT’D)
I'm sorry I burst in like that.
STOKER
Would have been best if you'd 
stayed onboard.
JOSEPHINE
Weasel tried something.
STOKER
Did he now? Well I'm surprised he's 
still breathing.
JOSEPHINE
I thought we might need him later.
STOKER
A taste of power reveals the truth 
of a man. Our betters are seldom 
better.
She hands the tiller to Stoker."
"66.
JOSEPHINE
I'll get a fresh brew.
She scoops up their tea mugs, and shuffles down the Charon. 
Weasel passes her on the other side of the boat, still making 
a point of not looking at her.
INT. CHARON ENGINE ROOM - DAWN
Josephine places a brass kettle on the engine, as Corky 
shovels some more coal on the fire.
JOSEPHINE
How's she holding up?
Corky tilts his hand left and right. Josephine points to a 
box of tea.
JOSEPHINE (CONT’D)
You want another?
Corky hands her his mug. Their hands brush. They both flinch 
away, and make a point of not looking at each other.
EXT. CHARON COCKPIT - DAWN
Weasel leans against the cockpit, swigging from his flask. 
Stoker watches him - what am I going to do with you?
STOKER
The tunnel is ahead. Then it's all 
Mr Lyle's land. Where we can hope 
people will be less bold, or 
stupid.
WEASEL
Looked very cosy back here, with 
Bosun not even cold in the ground.
STOKER
Joe's a good lad. You never should 
have signed him up.
It takes Weasel only a moment to realise he's got something 
over Stoker, and he revels in it.
WEASEL
Joe wanted this. Taking up the 
reins of his father's debt. She's 
example to us all.
STOKER
Do him right. Spare him this life.
Stoker doesn't beg, but that last bit sounded awful close. 
Enough for Weasel to ruminate before replying."
"67.
WEASEL
Doing right hasn't been working 
well for people recently.
STOKER
Maybe Bosun had a point about our 
cargo.
WEASEL
You're turning traitor as well?
Josephine reappears with two mugs of tea.
STOKER
Strikes me, that we could be done 
with this whole affair if the 
Charon were to find its way to the 
bottom of the canal.
WEASEL
You wouldn't dare.
JOSEPHINE
We have to get there!
Josephine sits down next to Stoker and hands him his tea.
JOSEPHINE (CONT’D)
You gave your word. The only way 
this gets done is when we reach 
Bill Lyle.
Weasel looks at Josephine. He's amazed.
WEASEL
On that we are in accord.
Stoker looks at Josephine - What are you up to? Josephine 
picks up the boat hook and stands.
JOSEPHINE
I'll get back on the bow.
EXT. CHARON BOW - DAY
Josephine stands on the bow. She spots a fish in the water, 
but hesitates before striking. It's already dead.
Then she spots another dead fish, and another until the 
entire river is filled with dead fish.
The Charon slices through the grim scene, leaving the mass of 
dead bodies behind it."
"68.
EXT. GYPSY CAMP BY CANAL - DAY
Covered wagons are parked up by the side of the river. 
Children run around them. Horses are tied up nearby. No 
adults are visible.
The Charon motors past.
The children wave at the boat, Stoker waves back.
EXT. CHARON - DAY
From the bow of the boat Josephine spots the tunnel 
approaching.
JOSEPHINE
Our chimney seems awful tall for 
that tunnel.
STOKER
Prepare to see a miracle of British 
engineering.
Stoker pulls on a handle by the tiller. The chimney wobbles a 
little. Stoker yanks the handle again. Nothing.
He sighs and he pulls out a hammer from a toolkit by the 
cabin doors. Then he stands, slowly and with pain.
Wincing with every step, Stoker shuffles down the boat 
towards the chimney. 
Once there he smacks the chimney with the hammer. 
Clang.
It folds down immediately on a metal hinge, lying flat along 
the back of the boat. The Charon will fit in the tunnel 
easily now. 
Smoke continues to puff out of the top of the Charon, it 
sounds a little more ragged than before.
Stoker does a little bow, cursing to himself as he 
straightens up again. That hurt more than he expected.
He looks down the length of the tunnel. Seeing the exit as a 
tiny spot of light in the distance. He frowns and peers. Was 
that something? No probably nothing.
Stoker makes his way back to the cockpit of the Charon.
EXT. CANAL TUNNEL ENTRANCE - DAY
The tunnel looms dark. Weeds and other river plants crowd the 
entrance. "
"69.
The Charon glides into the tunnel, its steam engine echoing 
through the darkness as it enters.
WEASEL
Shouldn't you light some lamps?
STOKER
Nothing left to burn in them, 
unless you fancy sharing some of 
that libation?
Weasel hugs the bottle of booze closer to him, almost burying 
it in his grimy waistcoat.
JOSEPHINE
What if we hit something?
STOKER
That's why we need you on the bow, 
with your boat hook.
Josephine grabs the boat hook from on top of the cabin and 
shuffles to the front of the boat.
JOSEPHINE
I can't see a damn thing.
The echo of her voice dances up and down the tunnel.
A light flares up from the front of the boat. Corky appears, 
holding a make-shift torch of some rags bundled around some 
wood. 
He leans forward and hands it to Josephine.
JOSEPHINE (CONT’D)
Thank you.
The flickering light from the flame dances over the brick 
walls of the tunnel.
The steam engine skips a beat. Corky immediately disappears 
back inside the hatch. Stoker curses.
WEASEL
I don't want to get stuck in this 
tunnel.
STOKER
On that we can agree.
The engine coughs again.
WEASEL
That doesn't sound good."
"70.
STOKER
It's the better of two outcomes. 
Take the tiller, try not to hit the 
walls.
Stoker stands - ouch - and shuffles forward.
WEASEL
Well what's the other?
STOKER
We explode and our precious cargo 
goes with us.
The steam engine coughs again. Clunks and then stops.
WEASEL
Beyond the grave, Bosun is still 
giving us trouble.
The tunnel is silent, but for the sound of the torch in 
Josephine's hand burning and the slow drip of water.
The Charon slows.
INT. CHARON ENGINE ROOM - DAY
The fire grate on the engine is open, the glow from the 
engine gives us just enough light to see.
Corky works on the engine, trying to coax it back to life.
Stoker lowers himself into the room through the hatch. He 
stands next to Corky.
STOKER
Gone?
Corky nods.
STOKER (CONT’D)
Anything you can tease out of it?
Corky thinks for a bit. Tries a valve. Nothing happens.
He shakes his head.
STOKER (CONT’D)
Get a brew on, looks like you're 
doing this the old fashioned way.
Corky grabs a brass kettle and places it on one corner of the 
still hot steam engine."
"71.
EXT. CHARON - CONTINUOUS
Stoker appears from the engine room.
STOKER
Joe, give that torch to Weasel. 
We're going to need you.
Josephine throws the boat hook on top of the cabin and 
shuffles down the side towards Weasel.
STOKER (CONT’D)
Engine is gone. Have you heard of 
legging?
Josephine shakes her head. Stoker removes his cap and rubs 
his brow.
STOKER (CONT’D)
Today is going to be educational 
then. 
JOSEPHINE
Why me?
STOKER
You're the youngest. There are 
traditions.
Josephine sighs heavily and hands the torch to Weasel.
STOKER (CONT’D)
You're going to learn a skill from 
the time before steam. How many 
people get to do that? Get top of 
the cabin. Legs in the air.
She clambers on top. Her feet reach the ceiling easily.
STOKER (CONT’D)
That's it. Now just step and push 
us forward. Don't try to go too 
fast, this ain't a sprint.
Josephine walks her feet on the ceiling. She slips at first, 
sending a spray of brick dust and water on herself.
She brushes it off her face and continues walking. Settling 
into a steady pace.
The Charon gently moves forward. Stoker nods and shuffles 
down to take the tiller off Weasel.
JOSEPHINE
(Already breathing hard)
How long do I have to do this?"
"72.
STOKER
Until you run out of tunnel.
WEASEL
What happens when we run out of 
tunnel?
STOKER
Hire some horses to pull us the 
rest of the way.
WEASEL
Who is paying for that?
STOKER
Either you get us horses, or you 
wait until we fix the engine. Could 
take weeks. I'm beyond caring 
either way. That's it Joe. Steady 
pace, nice and smooth.
Corky pulls himself up alongside Josephine. He winces as he 
lies down on his back.
Once he is settled, he mirrors her motions. Both of them 
using their feet on the ceiling to gradually push the boat 
forward.
Josephine mouths 'Thank you' at Corky.
In the darkness his hand searches. He finds hers. They 
interlace their fingers. 
She glances at him briefly - a smile.
EXT. CANAL TUNNEL EXIT - DAY
Deacon and his men lie in the sun by the exit of the tunnel. 
They've been waiting a while. 
A few of them smoke cigarettes. Other's are idly picking out 
dirt from under their nails with long knives. They are bored.
Deacon sits up. Did he hear something?
He scrambles towards the entrance to the tunnel and listens, 
making sure not to stand where he could be seen from inside.
He likes what he hears. He hisses to his men.
They stand up and ready their weapons.
INT. CANAL TUNNEL - DAY
Josephine and Corky march in step as they push the Charon 
through the tunnel with their feet."
"73.
Both of them are breathing hard and soaked in sweat.
Behind them Stoker is on the tiller with Weasel next to him. 
Neither one is smiling.
The Charon glides past.
In front of it we see the exit to the tunnel slowly grow in 
size. They are nearly out.
EXT. CANAL TUNNEL EXIT - DAY
Deacon signals to a couple of his men. They climb through the 
undergrowth to get above the tunnel exit, ready to drop down.
Deacon pulls a set of brass knuckles out of his pocket. He 
takes a puff of his cigar.
INT. CANAL TUNNEL - DAY
The torch in Weasel's hand burns down to his fingers. He 
flicks it away in pain and it fizzles out in the water.
The Charon is now close enough to the exit that we can see 
using only the dim light from outside.
Corky is exhausted. He's lowered his legs, and is fighting to 
breathe. Josephine steps on, a determined look on her face. 
She won't let it beat her.
Stoker sniffs, and frowns. Where does he recognise that smell 
from?
EXT. CANAL TUNNEL EXIT - DAY
Deacon and his men wait outside the exit to the tunnel.
Guns are checked. Hands tense on weapons.
INT. CANAL TUNNEL - DAY
The front of The Charon eases out of the tunnel.
Stoker is on the tiller, frowning. Eyes watching everywhere. 
He knows something is up. But what?
STOKER
(low voice)
Get your gun out.
Weasel pulls his gun out and checks it's loaded. It's EMPTY! 
Weasel snaps the revolver closed again, before anyone 
notices. He looks around nervously."
"74.
Stoker looks forward, peering into the daylight. The hairs on 
the back of his neck are raised.
Josephine and Corky steps on. One foot after the other along 
the ceiling. Their legs shake with exhaustion. 
The Charon drifts on.
EXT. CANAL TUNNEL EXIT - DAY
The men look towards Deacon, waiting for his signal.
He holds his hand out, palm visible - Wait for it. Wait.
The front of the Charon emerges from the tunnel.
We see Corky and Josephine on the top of the boat. Legs limp. 
Panting, delirious with exhaustion. They have their arms over 
their eyes. Too tired to see.
One of Deacon's men goes to jump on the boat, another man 
restrains him. Not yet you fool. Wait for the signal.
All eyes on Deacon. The boat moves forward. Deacon drops his 
hand.
DEACON
Now! 
The men hanging above the tunnel drop down. Landing on the 
deck with a thud. One of them stumbles slightly, but then 
regains his footing.
They both draw knives and rush forward to Josephine and Corky 
who only have time to look before they are pounced on and 
pinned to the cabin.
Corky wriggles free and lamps one of the men, knocking him 
off the boat. Corky then turns and kicks the man holding 
Josephine down. Booting him in the side. The man crumples up.
They are both free. Corky grabs the boat hook, spinning it 
his hands, ready for a fight.
BANG.
Corky jerks and falls, dropping the boat hook onto the roof. 
He slides down the side of the Charon. His Fingers grip on 
the side of the boat. He looks at Josephine.
BANG.
What's left of Corky tumbles into the water.
JOSEPHINE
No!"
"75.
Deacon appears. A smoking gun in his hand.
Other men leap on board the boat from both sides. Some piling 
into the engine room, others rushing towards the rear.
A couple of men grab Josephine, she struggles in vain.
EXT. CHARON COCKPIT - DAY
In seconds. Weasel and Stoker are surrounded by men armed 
with guns and long butcher's blades. All held ready.
Stoker has Weasel's pistol out, but not pointed at any one. 
He's outnumbered.
Deacon pushes his way past the men and stands on the cabin,  
towering over Stoker and Weasel.
DEACON
How do, Stoker, Weasel.
He looks around.
DEACON (CONT’D)
Where is Gunner hiding?
WEASEL
He's not with us.
That's not what Deacon was expecting.
DEACON
Bosun?
STOKER
He's Dead.
DEACON
Check the engine room.
One of Deacon's men pokes his head through the hatch to the 
engine room. All clear from the men in there.
He shakes his head at Deacon - No sign of anyone.
DEACON (CONT’D)
My, you have been in the wars. 
(a snarl)
Put the gun down, Weasel.
Weasel slowly turns the revolver towards Deacon.
DEACON (CONT’D)
What do you think happens to your 
crew if you squeeze that trigger?"
"76.
He tilts his head slightly, towards Josephine. A threat 
there.
JOSEPHINE
Shoot him, Weasel. If my death is 
the price to end his prattling then 
I pay it willingly.
Deacon wasn't expecting that, but he is impressed. Weasel 
puts his revolver on the floor and raises his hands.
DEACON
Well lads, I think we've done Mrs 
Weaver proud today. We might even 
get a little sweetener.
Deacon turns to one of his men.
DEACON (CONT’D)
Secure that crate then get the 
engine started. I want this 
floating coffin turned around and 
motoring home before anyone gets 
too curious.
STOKER
If you can get that engine going 
I'll hire you on the spot. Recent 
events have caused me to be short a 
couple of crew.
DEACON
Bold to be trying fresh japes while 
I hold your life in my hands like a 
sparrow's egg.
WEASEL
Why do you think we weren't using 
the engine, you idiot?
Deacon nods to one of his men. The man smacks Weasel about 
the head.
EXT. CHARON - LATER
The powerless Charon floats in the middle of the water. 
Deacon stomps along the cabin. Stoker, Weasel and Josephine 
are in the cockpit, with guns pointed at them.
One of Deacon's men appears from the engine room.
DEACON'S MAN
It's broken.
Deacon points his gun at the man."
"77.
DEACON
I know that, what I asked you to do 
was rectify the situation.
The man is unimpressed. It's not the first gun pointed at 
him.
DEACON (CONT’D)
You sure you can't fix it, Stoker?
JOSEPHINE
The engine was Corky's job and you 
shot him, twice.
Deacon looks at Josephine - Maybe I'll shoot you and all.
WEASEL
Oh dear, not turning out like you 
hoped? 
DEACON
We're the ones with the guns here.
WEASEL
This smells like someone's first 
show. Lot of lads, no plan. You 
still sure Mrs Weaver will pat you 
on the head?
Deacon's confidence wavers, just for a moment. He licks his 
lips. We see a hint of a scared man out of his rightful 
place, then Deacon shuts it down.
DEACON
You're talking like a man who 
thinks he has too many teeth.
WEASEL
My dentistry is the least of your 
concerns.
The men are all watching Deacon. They can tell the situation 
is getting out of his control. 
MALE VOICE (O.S.)
Need a tow?
All heads turn. A Romani man is leading a shaggy heavy horse 
along the canal path. 
The horse is wearing a harness, with coils of rope looped 
over it's back. It's a canal boat towing team.
Deacon beams. 
DEACON
This day keeps getting better. Much 
obliged."
"78.
We see the man with the horse more clearly now. It's Manfri!
MANFRI
Ten bob a day.
Deacon looks at the crate.
DEACON
Done.
MANFRI
I reckon some of my folk could get 
that motor running again if you've 
got a mind to.
DEACON
No. I've had enough of boats. But 
if you can find a cart and some 
horses I'll pay you handsomely. 
Manfri nods and throws a rope to one of Deacon's men.
MANFRI
This way then.
EXT. CANAL PATH - DAY
Manfri turns the horse around and clicks his mouth. The horse 
presses its body forward as it takes the weight of pulling 
the massive narrow boat on its shoulders.
Manfri leads the horse on. His head is down, watching the 
path. He couldn't look less of a threat if he tried. He 
whistles a cheery tune.
The Charon glides on, pulled by the horse. 
EXT. CHARON COCKPIT - DAY
Josephine leans into Stoker, all the while watching the guns 
trained on them. They speak in whispers.
Stoker reaches down to grab his razor, but has to stop as 
Deacon turns to watch him.
JOSEPHINE
What do you know?
STOKER
Keep your head down when it kicks 
off. Don't be clever. Survive.
DEACON (O.S.)
What are you two wittering about?"
"79.
STOKER
You've won. There's more than 
enough blood in our wake already. 
Let us go.
Deacon licks his lips.
DEACON
Oh no. I think I need to use all of 
you to send a message. A message so 
people understand what happens if 
they don't do what I want.
He tucks his gun away.
DEACON (CONT’D)
I think I'll gut the boy first, so 
you all get to watch. Let's see 
where he keeps his magic.
(Points at Josephine)
Reeves.
No one moves. Deacon frowns.
DEACON (CONT’D)
Reeves.
Deacon turns to face Reeves.
DEACON (CONT’D)
I said cut him.
Reeves looks confused. Baffled even. He opens his mouth to 
speak. Blood comes out.
He falls backwards off the boat, we see a knife sticking out 
of him.
EXT. CHARON - DAY
With a roar Romani stream out of the undergrowth along the 
canal and leap on board.
They are armed with long blades, some even have ancient 
swords.
Deacon's men turn to fight them. They are big lads, used to 
things getting messy but the Romani fight like demons.
Weapons ring out as blades hit each other. A volley of 
gunfire causes several bodies to fall into the water. In the 
melee it's hard to tell which side is winning."
"80.
EXT. CHARON COCKPIT - DAY
Deacon empties his gun into a Romani, firing until the weapon 
clicks. The Romani slumps forward, dropping his KNIFE ON THE 
TOP OF THE CABIN before sliding off into the water.
Deacon reaches into his pocket for more ammunition.
While he is distracted Stoker rises out of the cockpit and 
punches Deacon in the kidney. 
Deacon slumps forward on the ship, scattering a handful of 
bullets. He groans.
One of Deacon's men takes a swing at Stoker. Stoker ducks.
Josephine tries to help Stoker in the fight, he pushes her 
down. Stay out of this.
STOKER
Weasel!
Weasel looks around, clearly terrified.
WEASEL
What?
STOKER
The gun!
Weasel grabs the revolver, and one of Deacon's bullets. He 
tries to load it, but gets knocked to the floor in the brawl.
Stoker fights next to him, with Josephine trying to help. 
Stoker does everything he can to keep her out of the fight.
STOKER (CONT’D)
We have to get off the boat.
Josephine scoops up TWO BULLETS and hands them to Weasel. 
Weasel finally slides the bullets into his revolver. He fires 
at the man attacking Stoker. 
The shot hits the man clean in the chest, he falls backwards 
off the boat.
JOSEPHINE
We can't leave the cargo.
STOKER
It's gone. Someone needs to escape 
and tell Mr Lyle what happened.
WEASEL
And that will be me.
We see Weasel now has his pistol pointed towards Josephine 
and Stoker."
"81.
STOKER
Weasel?
WEASEL
I'll make sure he is aware of your 
brave sacrifice.
He waves the pistol, motioning Stoker and Josephine away from 
the rear of the boat. Behind them the battle between Deacon's 
men and the Romani rages on.
STOKER
Weasel. You and I are damned 
whatever happens. Let the child go.
Stoker pushes Josephine behind him. She pushes him away 
angrily and steps forward slightly.
JOSEPHINE
You've only got one bullet, Mr 
Weasel. Best make it count.
Stoker grins when he catches up.
STOKER
You get to kill one of us easy, the 
other is going to take a fight. Who 
will it be?
WEASEL
Well that's simple.
He swings the pistol round to point it at Stoker.
The moment the gun is no longer pointed at her, Josephine 
stamps on Weasel's foot. 
In one smooth motion Stoker pushes Weasel's pistol to the 
side and STABS WEASEL IN THE HEART using his razor.
Weasel's eyes go wide with shock. Stoker takes the gun out of 
his hand gently, and lowers him to the floor.
STOKER
Shhh. It's over now.
Weasel blinks a couple of times and then is still. 
Stoker uses a rag to wipe the blood off the handle of the 
razor and picks up the gun.
Josephine grabs the boat hook. Stoker looks at her. Could he 
be proud?
They ready their weapons."
"82.
EXT. CHARON - DAY
Deacon's men battle the Romani. Most of the guns have been 
emptied now, so it's down to messy hand-to-hand combat.
Blood is being spilled.
Stoker and Josephine move to the edge of the boat, a shot 
ricochets off the gunwale, causing them to duck away.
DEACON
Where do you think you are going?
Deacon stands nearby with his pistol pointed at them.
STOKER
Go. Make sure old Bill gets what 
he's due.
Josephine nods and races down the side of the boat. 
We hear a shot fired. 
Josephine turns and sees Stoker fall over, clutching his 
stomach.
As she turns back a club smacks her in the face. THWACK. She 
tumbles backwards into the canal.
EXT. CHARON COCKPIT - DAY
Manfri leaps onto the cabin of the Charon. He's holding a 
sword that looks a thousand years old.
Deacon frantically pushes more bullets into his revolver.
DEACON
What are you going to do with that 
relic, old man?
He points the revolver at Manfri.
As Deacon fires, the boat rocks as it hits the shore. The 
shot goes wild.
Manfri jumps forward and stabs him. Deacon crumples, 
clutching his chest.
The rest of the fight is short and brutal. The Romani butcher 
their foes.
As the last body is pushed into the water, Manfri clicks his 
mouth. The horse resumes pulling the Charon.
As the boat glides down the canal it leaves floating bodies 
spinning slowly in its wake."
"83.
EXT. FIELD - SUNSET
On a patch of scrub-land. A group of Romani sit around a 
fire. Most are bandaged up or still bleeding.
Behind them, tied up along the canal front we see The Charon.
EXT. CHARON - SUNSET
Lash climbs out of the engine room and onto the shore, 
cleaning his hands with an oily rag.
LASH
Someone had slipped the couplings. 
She'll run well enough now.
Manfri signals to a handful of Romani to get on board.
MANFRI
We'll leave with the sunrise. Don't 
let anyone touch the box, no matter 
what they say.
The guards turn to the cargo. Curiosity clear on their faces.
EXT. CANAL SHORE - SUNSET
A hand rises out of the water, and grabs the shore. With a 
grunt a muddy figure pulls themselves out of the water.
Once they are out of the water, they reach back behind them 
and drag a body out. This one is larger. It's hard work.
When both are fully out of the water. The first figure slumps 
down. Breathing hard. The larger body speaks.
STOKER
You should have left me.
He pushes himself up onto one elbow. And coughs.
JOSEPHINE
Didn't seem right.
STOKER
You lost your hat.
Josephine touches her head to check. She gets a fistful of 
mud and hair. No hat.
JOSEPHINE
I feel like we're past the point of 
deception.
Stoker wipes mud off his chest. Blood is visible on his hand. "
"84.
STOKER
The cargo is lost and Weasel is 
dead. Mr Lyle will have no trace of 
you. You're free.
(cough)
Home's that way.
Josephine pulls herself to her feet.
JOSEPHINE
I have a debt that must be paid.
Stoker shakes as he coughs.
STOKER
Your father had a great many fine 
qualities, but sadly forgiveness 
wasn't one of them. 
Stoker pats his pockets looking for his pipe. He finds it has 
shattered. It breaks his heart.
STOKER (CONT’D)
Perhaps you've inherited more than 
his eyes. Well if your is mind set.
He and pulls out his razor, offering it to her.
JOSEPHINE
How long have you known?
She takes the razor.
STOKER
Since you stepped on board.
Stoker looks out across the water. His breathing is laboured 
and uneven. 
JOSEPHINE
Stoker, I don't know your real 
name.
STOKER
It's been so long, I can barely 
remember who I was.
Stoker shakes as he coughs, Josephine holds him, trying to 
help him breathe easier.
JOSEPHINE
I didn't pull you out of the water 
for you to die now. I need you.
Stoker looks at her."
"85.
STOKER
You need a miracle. Bosun didn't 
think you'd get this far. When I 
see him, he'll owe me a shilling.
Stoker groans as he tries to get comfortable. Josephine takes 
her coat off, rolls it up and places it behind his head.
STOKER (CONT’D)
Silas, that was my name. 
JOSEPHINE
Josephine, pleased to make your 
acquaintance, Silas.
Stoker doesn't reply. He is dead. 
Josephine slumps to the floor, utterly alone and lost. She 
hugs her knees to her chest. Her eyes sparkle with tears.
EXT. FIELD - NIGHT
Most of the men around the fire are drinking. Manfri is 
amongst them, celebrating.
EXT. CANAL SIDE - NIGHT
Josephine staggers along the canal, shivering and in a daze. 
She sees bodies floating in the water.
There is movement on the opposite bank. A deer, looking at 
her. They gaze at each other, transfixed.
We hear shouts in the distance. The animal is startled and 
runs off into the trees. 
Josephine watches it, but her eye is caught by a metal glint 
in the reeds. 
After a brief struggle Josephine reemerges with her BOAT HOOK 
from the Charon. She hefts in her hands. Feeling the weight.
A nod. That will do. She breaks into a run.
EXT. FIELD - NIGHT
The fire is now down to embers. Most of the camp is asleep.
Manfri jerks awake, drawing his sword. Listening into the 
night. After a few heartbeats he puts his blade away again.
A horse whinnies. Something snaps.
Manfri kicks a couple of men awake and they head towards the 
noise."
"86.
EXT. ANOTHER FIELD - NIGHT
A horse rears up.
Manfri holds out his hand and makes soothing noises, calming 
the spooked animal.
EXT. MOORED CHARON - NIGHT
Josephine sneaks towards the Charon. We see three guards on 
board. They are fiddling with the crate.
One of them tries to lever a corner open with a knife.
She moves closer. Someone reaches out and GRABS HER.
EXT. FIELD - DAWN
Manfri stands by the fire with a group of his warriors. They 
are looking at a cloth map.
MANFRI
We need to find somewhere he won't 
be looking.
LASH
Good luck, he once chased a debt to 
Shanghai.
Josephine nearby, on her knees. Her hands are tied.
JOSEPHINE
You don't understand how dangerous 
it is.
MANFRI
And yet you've come back for it. 
Tells me you're more afraid of Old 
Bill than what's in that box.
JOSEPHINE
Why do you want it?
MANFRI
We've been under the boot of Bill 
Lyle for too long.
Josephine looks up.
JOSEPHINE
Then we might find ourselves as 
allies.
MANFRI
Can't fault your heart girl, but 
don't know you. Can't trust you."
"87.
He turns to the men holding her.
MANFRI (CONT’D)
Take her to the edge of the camp, 
and turn her loose.
Behind him there are shouts.
One of the guards from the boat steps into the firelight. 
BLOOD is streaming from his eyes, ears, nose and mouth.
He takes another step and falls over dead.
The camp erupts into pandemonium.
EXT. CANAL SIDE - NIGHT
Lit by torchlight, Manfri tips a body over with his foot. The 
gathered Romani are behind him.
The body flops onto its back. It's the other boat guard. He's 
dead. His eyes and mouth are ringed with blood.
LASH
They looked inside and it killed 
them. Patrin got it shut, but too 
late for him.
Lash gestures towards the body draped over the crate.
Everyone but Manfri takes a few steps back.
TALL ROMANI
You shouldn't have brought it here, 
we've got our kin with us.
MANFRI
None of us knew it would do this.
LASH
Evil like this should be sent back 
to hell. I say we sink it.
The Romani cheer.
MANFRI
We've paid a great deal to get it. 
Giving it up would mean those that 
died did it for nothing.
OLD ROMANI
And what about those of us that 
want to live?
TALL ROMANI
What's in that box isn't for us."
"88.
Rosella touches Manfri's arm.
ROSELLA
There's no honey here, father, only 
death.
Manfri looks at the Charon.
MANFRI
We'll take it to Bill. 
LASH
You want to take that hellish 
instrument to the devil himself, 
walk into his parlour and beg for 
silver?
MANFRI
Only he knows its worth.
LASH
Are you volunteering?
Manfri looks around at the Romani. No one moves. His eyes 
settle on Rosella.
Josephine steps into the light.
JOSEPHINE
I'll go.
MANFRI
You'd take that risk?
Josephine looks at him in defiance.
EXT. FIELD OF WHEAT - DAY
The sun beats down on the golden crop swaying in the wind.
Men with scythes twist rhythmically as they work their way 
through the wheat. Behind them teams of women and children 
tie the bundles of wheat together into sheaves.
At the edge of the field is a canal. The pock-marked Charon 
moves slowly.
Josephine is at the tiller. She's clearly exhausted. More 
like a ghost than a person.
A YOUNG BOY, 8, in fancy clothes appears. He ignores everyone 
around him and places a chair on the edge of the water. He 
sets up a table next to it. A parasol is carefully 
positioned.
Finally a set of scales is placed on the table."
"89.
As he leaves, everyone else downs tools and disappears. 
Workers, women, even the children quietly walk away.
The busy scene is suddenly silent.
Josephine watches, what is this?
A FINE GENTLEMAN steps out of the wheat. He's tall, 40s, and 
dressed in an immaculate grey morning suit with a top hat.
He walks with a stick, not due to a limp but because it 
pleases him to do so.
In his other hand is a chain. At the end of the chain are 
THREE DOGS, dalmatians. The dogs strain against the chain, 
the tension presses their three heads close together.
The fine gentleman strides confidently to the chair and sits 
down, tugging the knees of his trousers as he sits so they 
don't stretch. The dogs sit at his feet.
The Charon slides to a halt against the canal edge.
The man speaks. His voice is deep and commanding. He someone 
used to being obeyed.
FINE GENTLEMAN
I believe you have something that 
belongs to me.
He pulls an ANCIENT KNIFE out of his pocket and places it on 
the table next to the scales.
JOSEPHINE
And you are?
Josephine glances at the knife. What's that for?
FINE GENTLEMAN
You would know me as Mr Lyle. Where 
is Weasel?
JOSEPHINE
Dead.
MR LYLE
And the rest of the crew?
JOSEPHINE
Same.
No reaction from Mr Lyle.
MR LYLE
And what of my precious cargo?"
"90.
Josephine kicks the crate with her foot. Mr Lyle narrows his 
eyes slightly as she does. Not a wince exactly but he'd 
prefer she didn't do that.
JOSEPHINE
It's all here.
Josephine steps off the boat.
Mr Lyle gestures with his hand. A half-dozen men in heavy 
canvas protective gear and brass breathing apparatus appear. 
They carefully lift the crate onto the shore and then 
disappear again.
MR LYLE
Then all that remains is the matter 
of payment.
Josephine nods. Mr Lyle places a bag on scales, and slowly 
drops gold coins into the bag until it's balanced. 
She walks up to Mr Lyle and scoops the bag up. 
He grabs her wrist.
MR LYLE (CONT’D)
I need your name to pay you. 
Everything must be proper in my 
ledger.
She twists her hand free and bounces the bag a couple of 
times. It's heavy. 
MR LYLE (CONT’D)
A tidy sum to find yourself in 
possession of, especially for one 
so young.
She looks at the knife.
MR LYLE (CONT’D)
But not yours yet.
JOSEPHINE
The debts of the crew. I want them 
settled. They did the work.
She nods toward the crate.
MR LYLE
They are dead.
JOSEPHINE
Then they paid enough."
"91.
MR LYLE
That is a matter of opinion.
(leaning forward)
You seem familiar.
Josephine holds his gaze. 
MR LYLE (CONT’D)
Very well. The debts will be 
cleared.
JOSEPHINE
I want to see you do it, in your 
fancy book.
Mr Lyle measures Josephine up. After a heartbeat he waves his 
hand. The young boy appears again, trotting along with a 
gigantic ancient book.
Mr Lyle opens the book, searching for an entry. He pulls out 
an old-fashioned pen and marks the page with red ink.
MR LYLE
Albert Cashier, Lyons Wakeman, 
Richard Shurtliff, Oliver Marlowe 
and Silas Bulkley.
He reaches forward into the bag and removes a gold coin for 
every name.
JOSEPHINE
You're missing one.
MR LYLE
I wondered when you'd bring your 
father up. Then you understand what 
happens to those who cross me.
She flinches, unnerved for a moment. Mr Lyle smirks. A whole 
argument played out between them without speaking.
Mr Lyle breaks away and scratches another mark on the page.
MR LYLE (CONT’D)
Settled. See.
He takes another coin and turns the book to face her. Five 
names crossed out.
Mr Lyle gestures to the bag of coins in Josephine's hand. 
Then rests his hand on top of the knife, not holding it, just 
making sure Josephine remembers it is there. 
MR LYLE (CONT’D)
However if you plan on keeping that 
coin, then I shall require your 
name in my book."
"92.
Josephine looks down at the coins. She picks up one and holds 
it up to the light.
MR LYLE (CONT’D)
Think what you could do with that 
money. Hot meals every night, thick 
coats in winter.
(A chuckle)
All the trappings that befit a 
person of means.
Josephine puts the coin back in and closes the bag. She wraps 
her fingers slowly around it.
MR LYLE (CONT’D)
You've already done all the hard 
work and all the suffering.
Mr Lyle traces a finger along the blade.
MR LYLE (CONT’D)
All I need is a name.
He looks at Josephine.
MR LYLE (CONT’D)
You did what other men could not. 
You brought me my cargo.
He turns his gaze to the box. A smile.
MR LYLE (CONT’D)
These are modern times. My 
organisation could do with someone 
as resourceful as you. Your 
prospects will change with my hand 
on your shoulder, Josephine.
JOSEPHINE
If you already know my name, why do 
you keep asking for it?
MR LYLE
Because, my dear. If we are to 
enter an arrangement then the 
contract must be agreed by both 
parties.
She looks Mr Lyle in the eye, opens her mouth to speak and 
then throws the bag at his feet. One of the dogs yelps.
MR LYLE (CONT’D)
Stupid girl, you would refuse a 
fortune?
Mr Lyle frowns and picks the bag up. He did not expect that. 
He looks down at the knife next to him. It's gone. "
"93.
He looks up. No sign of Josephine. What's going on?
Then a knife is at his throat. Josephine is behind him.
JOSEPHINE
You killed my father, your hand 
wasn't on the blade but you did it 
all the same. Did you think I 
wouldn't find out?
Mr Lyle's hands grab Josephine's arm, wrestling the knife 
away from his throat.
MR LYLE
You aren't the first to attempt to 
fell me, and you won't be the last.     
Mr Lyle grins as he feels himself overpowering Josephine. 
He's enjoying this. He turns the knife towards her chest.
MR LYLE (CONT’D)
I'm going to feed you to my dogs. 
Josephine's eyes are cold. 
Stoker's razor appears in her other hand. In one swift 
movement, it is across Mr Lyle's throat.
We see Mr Lyle's eyes go wide.
There is a soft thud as his body hits the ground.
Josephine throws the ancient knife aside and pockets the 
razor. 
She reaches for the bag of gold coins.
The dogs growl at her. She growls back. They turn and flee, 
whimpering as they disappear into the wheat.
Josephine takes the bag and heads to the Charon. 
She walks past the crate, stops and then returns to pick up 
the ancient book.
She carries it over to the water and throws it in.
EXT. CHARON - DAY
Josephine unties the mooring, throws the rope on board, and 
climbs on after it.
EXT. CANAL WATER - DAY
Bill Lyle's ledger disappears under the surface. No more 
debts."
"94.
EXT. CHARON - DAY
Josephine works the tiller as the Charon moves serenely 
through the water.
She picks up the bag of gold. Takes a single coin out for 
herself and throws the bag to Manfri on the shore. He catches 
it.
Josephine reaches under the sill behind the tiller, and finds 
a cloth captain's cap that belonged to Stoker. She places it 
on her head.
Manfri watches Josephine, and her boat motor away upstream.
The woman who picked the devil's pocket and then slit his  
throat.
THE END."
