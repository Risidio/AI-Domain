India produces about 800 ﬁ  lms every year but not even eight get documented. 
There is no reading material available for ﬁ  lm students or ﬁ  lm lovers on the behind-
the-scenes action, the vision of the ﬁ  lmmakers, and the processes involved in making 
a ﬁ lm. Lage Raho Munnabhai: The Original Screenplay  was published last year. 
3 Idiots: The Original Screenplay  is our second attempt in this direction. This book 
is not just the screenplay; it is also a peek into the minds of its makers.
I would like to thank Smriti Kiran who took the initiative to come up with this 
book within 5 months of the release of the ﬁ  lm. She has spent many long days 
and long nights chasing the cast and crew, writing and rewriting, with a smile on her face. Without her persistence, this book would not have happened.
I would also like to thank Ajay Mago and his team at Om Books International for 
giving shape to our vision.
I also wish  to thank Maheep Dhillon for tirelessly redrafting the screenplay; Supriya 
Kelkar for her eye for detail;  Rohan Mapuskar for poring over the dialogues; Dileep Desai, Amit Gulati, Mustafa Neemuchwala, Teja Pratap, Insia Lacewalla for production support; Anupama Chopra for her invaluable insight.
And Vinod Chopra for clearing all obstacles as always.

"Every story has a back story and so does mine. 
My father, Suresh Hirani, was fourteen years old when he along with the family 
moved to India during Partition. Initially, they took shelter in refugee camps in Agra and later shifted to Ferozabad. He had lost everything so education was low on the priority list. There were more pressing and immediate concerns like food, clothes, and shelter to worry about. To make ends meet, my father started working in a bangle factory where he painted patterns on bangles. Later, he began selling ice-cream on the streets. Despite compelling and adverse circumstances, his thirst for knowledge did not wane. 
My father’s sister, who was married in Nagpur, got him a job there in a general 
store as a store attendant. The city brought with it opportunity. My father enrolled himself in night school. Work in the day and classes at night continued and he somehow managed to graduate. Fortiﬁ  ed with a degree and some savings, he was 
itching to grow. So when a friend suggested that typewriters, which were new at the time, were the future, my father decided to explore this avenue. He invested his life’s savings, borrowed the rest of the money needed and opened a typewriting institute which was referred to as a ‘Commerce Institute’ then. My father christened it ‘Rajkumar Commerce Institute’. I was not even born then. So now you know that I was named after a typewriting institute and not the other way round! Most parents would name their enterprises after their children, but I’ve had the rare honour of being named after my father’s enterprise. I’m proud of that fact.
My father’s business ﬂ  ourished. He got married and I was born soon after. The 
plan was to get into engineering but I didn’t have enough marks in my higher secondary exams (12th standard) to make the cut so I studied commerce. I had also enrolled in this foundation course for chartered accountancy simultaneously, 
the classes for which were held in the evenings. At the end of the foundation 
03_Introduction.indd   11 03_Introduction.indd   11 5/31/2010   1:47:17 AM 5/31/2010   1:47:17 AM"
"12course, the exams for chartered accountancy were to be held. I despised these 
classes from the very beginning. I had no interest in chartered accountancy and these classes were a huge imposition, both in terms of time and the fact that I was wasting this time on something I knew was not for me. But I had the baggage of the engineering debacle on my head so abandoning this very viable option would have appeared self-indulgent, foolish, and luxurious at the time. I was afraid I
would hurt my parents and also somewhat scared to take this step that could harm 
my ‘future’. I carried on with the charade. 
Subconsciously, I was aware that there were some set presumptions about my future. 
I was expected to either become a chartered accountant or take over my father’s business. Both possibilities mortiﬁ  ed me. Though at that point in time, I was not 
thinking about what would make me happy. Like any normal person, I had responsibilities and the usual concerns that range from job to future to career. As

"13the time for the foundation course’s exams drew close, I would often wake up in 
the middle of the night in cold sweat. 
Finally, the exams were upon me. I realised that there was no escaping the inevitable. 
It was imperative to tell my father that I found a root canal procedure more exciting than chartered accountancy. Even after twenty years, that evening is as clear in my head as if it had happened just yesterday. 
It was a regular evening in Nagpur but for me it was going to be the most signiﬁ  cant 
and decisive evening of my life. My father was standing alone in the living room. I walked in and walked up to where he was standing, taking lead-laden steps. My throat was dry with uncertainty and fear. It was one thing to tell your father that you did not want to pursue what seemed like an excellent career choice but it was another thing to not offer an alternative plan. The only thing I was clear about was that chartered accountancy was not my cup of tea. My voice quivered with apprehension as I told him that I did not want to take the exams because I did not enjoy chartered accountancy at all. He looked at me and then in the most nonchalant manner told me to not do it and join his ofﬁ  ce starting next morning. 
It was as short and simple as that. I was ecstatic. The weight of the world had lifted from my shoulders. I felt free. This happened during the period leading up to the festival Makar Sankranti  which is known for kite ﬂ  ying. I remember running up 
to our terrace right after ‘the conversation’ and ﬂ  ying kites with this silly grin on 
my face. Now, the kite ﬂ  ying seems almost like a symbol for the sense of freedom 
and relief that had swept over me that day. 
My commerce classes in college occupied only four hours of my time in the 
morning (7 am to 11.00 am), so the rest of my time was devoted to helping my father with his business (11.30 am to 6.30 pm) which had graduated from typing courses to repairing and selling new kinds of calculators and other ofﬁ  ce equipment. 
I immersed myself in it with the gusto of a man who had just been extracted from the gallows. I used to teach typing, go out and give demos to prospective clients, and repair spoiled units. I was even sent to Delhi to do a course in repairing electronic calculators. 
This is the period where I had my ﬁ  rst brush with theatre. I met Narendra Thakur 
and a few other students who used to perform and produce plays regularly at our college. I joined them. (Before this, my only experience on stage was in the 9th 
standard. I was cast in the role of ‘Noorjahan’ in a play.) I became a regular with the theatre gang. Abandoning the foundation course opened up my evenings to 
03_Introduction.indd   13 03_Introduction.indd   13 5/31/2010   1:47:22 AM 5/31/2010   1:47:22 AM"
"14be occupied, and occupied they were with writing, reading, and brainstorming 
about plays. This stirred something within me. I have always believed that there are two approaches to learning: one is to study something academically and the other is to get interested in something and then start to gather material on it and 
learn about it. The latter is always a more gratifying experience. I would hunt for Hindi plays in quaint bookshops. I would devour anything on theatre. We would participate in competitions, youth festivals, and travel to any place that even hinted at an opportunity for exposure in the ﬁ  eld. Youth festivals were a platform 
where teams from all the colleges in Nagpur came and performed. At one such festival, I met another theatre group which was performing for the Nagpur Medical College. There were a few people in that group, especially Debashish Naha, who were passionate about theatre and took this enterprise very seriously. There was an instant connection with Debashish and soon our friendship led to my theatre group merging with his to form a new theatre group called Awaaz . Debashish and 
I would spend hours working on plays. He would get me plays written in Bangla 
Finding his voice ... performing on stage (middle) for Awaaz , in Nagpur.
03_Introduction.indd   14 03_Introduction.indd   14 5/31/2010   1:47:22 AM 5/31/2010   1:47:22 AM"
"15and we would sit down and translate them in Hindi. We started putting up plays 
under our banner. Personalities such as Marathi theatre-director Kishore Kulkarni, who had received acclaim on stage were invited to direct plays for our group. We learnt under many such people who had a command over their craft and a natural ﬂ air for the medium. Since everyone was busy till 6 pm everyday, we used to meet 
after that. These meetings were held either at the Bengali Association Hall or at the Sindhi Gurudwara nearby which had a hall, or at the local school hall. Wherever 
we found some empty space, we parked ourselves. The rehearsals used to go on till midnight. 
We pursued this with such passion that theatre soon became an obsession. We 
managed to put up a record three to four plays a year. These plays were not restricted to performing at colleges. We started putting up ticketed shows. Apart from the creative aspect, the entire production of the play was handled by us. We organised everything from booking the hall, putting up the sets, props, costumes, accounts, and even ticketing. Watching plays was not the preferred pastime in Nagpur, so we used to sell the tickets to friends and relatives. Accounts were maintained diligently. In fact, I still have some of the accounts from those days. We used to barely cover our production costs and that is all we wanted. We were not doing this for proﬁ  t. 
We just wanted to be able to put up plays and hoped to cover costs and use the money to put up the next one. On those rare occasions, if anything was earned over and above the production cost, it ensured a grand meal for our entire group.
It was not difﬁ  cult to speak to my father the second time. Intuitive and observant, 
he was not blind to my growing passion for theatre. The suggestion to tread this path in earnest came from my father. He told me to enrol in a program to get formal education (my father is a great believer in learning) in the ﬁ  eld of writing, 
directing, and storytelling. The natural choice was to apply to the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII). 
My ﬁ  rst attempt (1983) to get into FTII in the direction course was unsuccessful. I 
had very little knowledge of the exam and the enrolment procedures. I had travelled to Mumbai to take the exam. There I learnt that the entrance exam for FTII was exactly like bank exams, and anyone studying for it would clear it without blinking. I also realised that seats for the direction course were few and almost everyone applied for this course. I came back to Nagpur and enrolled myself in the Faculty of Law as that seemed like a reasonable option if things did not work out. Alongside, I started preparing for the FTII exam. The next year (1984), I applied again to FTII but 
03_Introduction.indd   15 03_Introduction.indd   15 5/31/2010   1:47:30 AM 5/31/2010   1:47:30 AM"
"16this time for the editing and not the direction course. I got admission. The day I 
received the telegram, informing me about my admission to FTII, was the happiest day of my life. I was delirious with joy. I thought I had arrived and my life was made. This thought stemmed from naiveté. Sitting in Nagpur, I had only heard of the ten to ﬁ  fteen names of really successful people who had graduated from FTII 
so I assumed that getting admission meant I was set up for life. I looked at my admission in the Institute as one looks at getting into law school or engineering. Once you get in and work hard, the moment you graduate, you become a director. All these illusions were shattered two days into my time at FTII. My enthusiasm was replaced by an inferiority complex. I was from a small town in the midst of students waxing eloquent about theories, ﬁ  lms, and ideas that were Greek and 
Latin to me. It took me time but I found my feet again and got my voice back. It taught me a very important lesson: you cannot lose yourself just by perceiving yourself to know less. If stereotypes have to be broken, then ﬁ  rst they have to be 
broken within you. 
Learning the grammar of cinema ... at FTII.
03_Introduction.indd   16 03_Introduction.indd   16 5/31/2010   1:47:30 AM 5/31/2010   1:47:30 AM"
"17Thus, began the journey of disillusionment and enlightenment, unlearning and 
learning, passion, failure, and fulﬁ  llment. After three years at FTII, I moved to 
Mumbai (1987) and stayed with my friend and batchmate Sriram Raghavan 
(ﬁ lmmaker). My ﬁ  rst job was as an editor on an advertisement directed by Bharat 
Rangachari. After this, I was recommended by late editor Renu Saluja and I edited a documentary. I was paid Rs 1500 for my ﬁ  rst job and Rs 500 for the second one. 
But things were slow to come by. After sometime, the situation became precarious. Video had just exploded on the scene so we were hard pressed for assignments as we did not know how to edit on video. I could not even turn to my father for help because he was going through a ﬁ  nancial slump. His business of typewriters 
had taken a beating because of the arrival of computers. So both my father and I were facing what you can term a ‘technological gap’. 
The ﬁ  rst year in Mumbai (1987), after passing out from the Institute, was a difﬁ  cult 
one. I came very close to giving up during that year. There were many dark nights of the soul. I thought about going back to Nagpur. Maybe do something related to cinema there. It was a matter of survival, and the strangest options came to my mind. I entertained the idea of shooting marriage videos creatively and putting a completely unique spin to them. Maybe do multiple camera set-ups and scale things up considerably. Exports, which was a much talked about thing back then, was the other option that came to mind. I went to Fort in Mumbai (there are many street vendors of second-hand books in Fort) and picked up a book on exports. I was desperately groping in the dark trying to hold on to something. Fortunately, FTII revived its one-month video course that was promised to us. We rushed back to the Institute for the course. After one month, we returned to Mumbai with the knowledge of what would be our survival kit in the city: video editing. 
I joined an editing studio called Ekta Studio (1988) as an in-house editor on a 
monthly salary of Rs 1000. My six-month stint here gave me enough contacts and clout in the market to get regular work. I told myself, rather theatrically, that it mattered not if I didn’t make a lot of money: this life I have devoted to cinema. I convinced myself with something as dramatic as that. Once you accept this, then the dark nights disappear and all nights convert to being nights of battle: the battle to become better, to excel, to strive towards quality. 
During this phase of ﬁ  nding my feet in the business, Sanjay Leela Bhansali, my peer 
from FTII, who was assisting Vinod, called me to edit the promos of 1942: A Love 
Story (1992). But things did not go beyond that just yet. Meanwhile, from editing I 
03_Introduction.indd   17 03_Introduction.indd   17 5/31/2010   1:47:34 AM 5/31/2010   1:47:34 AM"
"18had moved up to directing advertising ﬁ  lms and opened my own production house 
called Canvas Films (1991). 
In 1998, I was called in to edit the promos of Kareeb  as well because Vinod had liked 
my work on 1942: A Love Story . This was again a one-off stint. I continued doing 
work in advertising. Canvas Films ﬂ  ourished and I became ﬁ  nancially secure.
I had settled into a comfortable pattern till the morning I received a call from 
Vinod (2000). He wanted me to edit Mission Kashmir . Not just the promos but the 
entire ﬁ  lm. Initially, I was reluctant as I did not want to leave a lucrative set-up. 
But once I learnt of Renu’s condition (Renu, Vinod’s ﬁ  rst wife and ﬁ  lm editor, was 
suffering from cancer and her condition was going from bad to worse with each passing day), I could not say no. It was during the making of Mission Kashmir  that 
my latent desire to direct a feature ﬁ  lm resurfaced. Watching cinema being made 
with such passion and commitment by Vinod and his team rekindled the spirit in me that I had in my theatre days. 
Miles to go before I sleep ...
03_Introduction.indd   18 03_Introduction.indd   18 5/31/2010   1:47:34 AM 5/31/2010   1:47:34 AM"
"19I knew I was ready to make a ﬁ  lm. And I began working on writing my ﬁ  rst ﬁ lm. 
How Munna Bhai came about is another long story but that I will keep for the 
book on Munna Bhai M.B.B.S .
So why did I just spill my guts and share my life with you? Simply because so much of 3 Idiots  is personal. I am a small town man from 
Nagpur with no connections or background in ﬁ  lms. I started working towards 
something that made me happy and that is all there is to it. I worked with passion and honesty, and even if success had not come my way, I would still have been really happy as I got to chase my dreams. 
It has been a long and wonderful ride, but the key here is, it has been a ride of my 
choice. The desire to make 3 Idiots  stemmed from this thought. I am not trying 
to say that engineering or chartered accountancy or any other profession for that matter is any less than wildlife photography or ﬁ  lmmaking, and so on. My belief is 
simple. Choose your own path. Choose without fear. It is not a foolproof formula for happiness or success but it is deﬁ  nitely one that is most likely to work.

While everyone listens transﬁ  xed, Rancho

You also are like the koel birds.
With a sudden movement, he turns over

A koel bird never makes her own nest. 
She lays her eggs in other nests. 
DIRECTOR 
And when they hatch, what do they do? 
DIRECTOR 
They push the other eggs out of the nest. "

One day, when I was a student, the Director of our institute called me. He said, “Viru Sahastrabuddhe.” I said, “Yes Sir” “Come here!” Main darr gaya. He showed me this pen. He said, “This is a symbol of excellence. I give it to you. Aur jis din tumhe tumahre jaisa koi extraordinary student mile, to yeh pen usse paas on kar dena.”

DIRECTOR
Battis saal se Viru Sahastrabuddhe is waiting for that student. But no luck. Anyone here, who’ll strive to win this pen?
Led by an over eager Chatur, whose hand 
shoots up ﬁ  rst, all the students raise their 
hands.
DIRECTOR 
Good. Put your hands down.
As all the hands go down, Rancho raises 
his. The Director looks up after putting the pen back in his shirt pocket. He sees the lone, raised hand.

And we slept peacefully. Then there was a theft and we learned that he couldn’t see at night! He’d just yell “Aal izz well”, and we felt secure. That day I understood this heart scares easily. You have to trick it. However big the problem, tell your heart, “Aal izz well, pal”.jktw

He starts sobbing uncontrollably at the

When he ﬁ  nally falls silent, there’s a dark 
hopelessness in his eyes. He starts walking. Unmindful of the wire his foot gets tangled in, he steps up on the sill of a large, open window in the room. He stands there a moment, facing the skyline.
There’s a crash, and a lamp in the room 
is yanked towards the window.

FADE OUTTHE END"
"THE METHOD  IN THE MADNESSTHE METHOD  IN THE MADNESS
Rajkumar Hirani, Abhijat Joshi, & Vidhu Vinod Chopra Recollect"
""
"In the course of putting this book together, the many conversations I had with Rajkumar 
Hirani revealed that in a life spanning over four decades ﬁ  lled with many challenging 
and debilitating experiences, the one that is clearly etched in his memory as the most oppressive of them all is the month preceding his 12th standard exams. “Every night I would get a recurring dream that I was taking an exam and I did not know the answer to even a single question. I would wake up in cold sweat,” he said. Raju attributes this to the fear psychosis created around exams and grades in India. The ﬁ rst few daunting months at FTII, a year without work and money in Mumbai, 
myriad struggles to set up a career, the Herculean task of making movies were lesser strains compared to the pressures of Higher Secondary exams in his life. 
It was no surprise then that when he started hunting for a subject he felt deeply 
about as the DNA for his ﬁ  rst feature ﬁ  lm, he decided on the story of three friends 
in a medical college. The aim was to weave a tale that enthralled with anecdotes from life in a hostel and make a comment both on the education system and the medical practice in India. For Raju, life in a hostel signiﬁ  ed freedom. The time he 
spent doing theatre with his group Awaaz  with the students from Nagpur Medical 
College, hostel life at FTII, and the horrors of education engineered towards grades were experiences that had left an indelible impression on him. Therefore, the ﬁ  rst 
draft of Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. had, instead of the lovable Bhai and his sidekick 
Circuit, three friends living in a medical college. The script and the ideas kept changing and evolving. At the end, the three friends had to wait and give way to the duo that became the Indian equivalent of Batman and Robin: the incorrigible and immensely endearing Munna and Circuit. 
But the initial idea that he started with lay latent in Raju’s subconscious for the 
next six years. Such must have been his desire to make this ﬁ  lm one day and 
so great the need for the world to have this idea translated on screen that the "
"322universe conspired to make it happen. Vidya Balan and the Mumbai deluge of 
2005 played signiﬁ  cant roles in pulling this blueprint out from the deep recesses 
of Raju’s mind. It was May 2005 and Vidya had just ﬁ  nished shooting for the 
ﬁ rst schedule of Lage Raho Munna Bhai . She and Raju had struck up an instant 
rapport often recommending interesting ﬁ  lms and books to each other. Vidya 
happened to read Five Point Someone  during this period. She knew Chetan so she 
was aware that he was keen to get the book across to Raju as possible material for a ﬁ  lm. Vidya immediately lent her copy of the book to Raju saying that this 
was an idea she felt had legs. But being in the middle of making a ﬁ  lm, Raju 
did not have time to breathe let alone read. The book gathered dust on his bookshelf for sometime. And then in July, Mumbai faced the worst rain-induced ﬂ oods ever. Life for everyone in Mumbai came to a standstill. Raju’s lane was 
completely ﬂ  ooded and he had no choice but to stay home for a couple of days. 
That is when he picked up Five Point Someone  and read it. The story of three 
friends and their experiences in an engineering college took him by surprise and brought to the fore his ﬁ  rst draft of Munna Bhai M.B.B.S . He discussed it with 
Vinod and Abhijat. The rights to adapt the book into a ﬁ  lm were bought and 
the rest as they say is history. 
The one-liner (a scene-wise synopsis of the screenplay and its trajectory) of 3 Idiots  
was ready in a record nine days and the ﬁ  rst draft of the screenplay with dialogues was 
ready in 18 days from the day Abhijat Joshi, Vidhu Vinod Chopra, and Rajkumar Hirani started working on it (2006). After that, it took the three writers, two-and-a-half years to arrive at a shooting script. 
The evolution of the screenplay involved ponderous work on innumerable drafts, 
multiple scenarios (some retained and many abandoned), copious amounts of green tea, long walks, and several trips around the globe. 
The journey was through a labyrinth of possibilities. [In some drafts Pia was Farhan’s 
ex-girlfriend; Chatur and not Suhas was to marry Pia; Farhan was an unhappy corporate honcho in New York; instead of wildlife photography, linguistics was Farhan’s passion; Joy and Phunsukh Wangdu were added and deleted frequently.] The key to the screenplay was to ﬁ  nd the best way forward that enabled the narrative 
to be consistently compelling, real, and entertaining. 
These interviews with the writers were recorded between January and April 2010, 
at various locations, in Mumbai. "
"323There is a method to the three of you working together. How does it work?
VC: We have been working together for many years and have immense mutual 
respect and affection for each other. Abhijat and I go back to the Kareeb  days 
and with Raju my writing association started with Munna Bhai M.B.B.S . I don’t 
sit with them and write continuously. My biggest contribution and challenge is to channelise their passion and energies in a direction. I am their rubbish radar. They do the writing and come to me constantly with material at regular intervals. I either change some things or add new things to it or reject it. My work here is of a good reviewer. 
RH: Abhijat and I write constantly while working on the screenplay and once we 
have a ready draft, we start the sessions with Vinod. He is brilliant at catching the problems, the chinks in the script, the ﬂ  aws. It is fantastic to get this kind of 
perspective on one’s work as one is going along. It keeps us on the right track.
AJ: The interesting thing about the three of us working together is the diversity 
in our methods of working which eventually enhances the material we work on. Vinod’s method of writing and Raju’s and my methods are completely different but our goal is the same: a great story. 
Raju and I operate by working on individual scenes and later binding them 
together which brings the desired unpredictability to our work whereas Vinod likes his character arcs and plot deﬁ  ned. Therefore, when we take the scenes to 
Vinod, he lends the necessary prespective to them. The principle which has been the guiding metaphor throughout Aristotle’s writings has been that the action of a narrative or drama must be presented as “a complete whole, with its several incidents 
so closely connected that the transposal [shifting an incident/scene from one point in 
the narrative to another]  or withdrawal of any one of them will disjoin and dislocate 
the whole.”  This is the principle that Vinod follows. His focus is the whole. Every 
scene in the ﬁ  lm must carry the story forward. It must have a purpose that serves 
this movement. You cannot narrate a scene to Vinod and tell him that the purpose of the scene is to make people laugh or cry. He will immediately throw it out. Scenes might be luminous on their own but they are useless if they do not light up the whole narrative is Vinod’s belief. Raju and I often get carried away by the individual scenes. In the second half of 3 Idiots,  Vinod took out a few dramatic 
scenes which in hindsight I feel would have weakened our ﬁ  lm. He believes that 
we cannot overload the audience because after a while, they stop caring. There is Fatigue that sets in. You need to have that balance where you don’t give in to the "
"324temptation of overdoing things. To give you an example, the speech scene was 
kept not because it was funny but because it had a purpose beyond making the audience laugh. The speech demonstrated the pitfalls of rote learning and brought the conﬂ  icting philosophies in the ﬁ  lm, of chasing excellence and blindly chasing 
success, out in the open. 
This is the way in which we work together. Different perspectives enable us to 
retain quality without losing focus. 
The germ of the idea came from Chetan Bhagat’s book Five Point Someone.  
What is it that drew you to the book?
RH: I loved the description of hostel life in the book. It instantly held my attention. 
I had lived in a the hostel, like the boys in the book, so it was very appealing to me. Education and the pressures one faces with regard to education that would result in a ‘better life’, the one deﬁ  ned by society and not necessarily by the individual, 
have always been of great interest to me. This gave me a wonderful opportunity to combine these thoughts with a few anecdotes from the book.
It took over two-and-a-half years for the screenplay to come together. What 
were the challenges that you faced while writing it?
RH: Five Point Someone,  though immensely enjoyable, was very anecdotal in its 
treatment. I knew the moment I read the book that we would have to spend considerable time adapting it into a screenplay. There is nothing in the book that binds it together. For a ﬁ  lm, a binding thread is critical. The audience has to be 
taken on a journey through the characters and plot. It has to move towards something to hold the attention of the viewers. For example, in Lagaan,  one of the things 
that keeps you hooked till the end is the cricket match. The whole ﬁ  lm is moving 
towards that. I could not ﬁ  nd this thread within the book and from there stemmed 
the desire to create an external story. The idea for the external story came to me in Kenya. The Kenyan Film Board had invited a select group of Indian ﬁ  lm directors 
and cinematographers to explore Kenya as a shooting destination for Indian ﬁ  lms. 
Therefore, Nikhil Advani, Shaad Ali, and I, including a few other directors and cinematographers, travelled to Kenya. Initially, as usual, I was very reluctant to go. What happens with me is that whenever I am invited to some place and if I am working, I start thinking that it is a waste of time, and, therefore, why should I go. This is the reason I decline most of the times and then I regret it. T wice over I passed "
"325up the opportunity to go to Australia thinking that I am working on my script and 
it would be a waste of time. In both cases, I could have easily gone and come back and my life would not have changed. So when this invitation came, sometime in March 2007, I decided I must go. I went but out of habit carried my laptop with me hoping I would ﬁ  nd time to get some work done there. On reaching Kenya, 
I discovered that they had a packed itinerary planned for us for each day of our stay. Obviously, they wanted to show us the maximum number of locations. The day used to start at 6 am and end at 9 pm. After two days of intense sightseeing, I got anxious about my script. I started getting very edgy. On the third day, I refused to go. Nikhil and everyone else started laughing at me. I realised that if I told them the truth, then I would not be able to escape so I lied and told them that I was not well. They left without me. I took out my laptop and started working on my script. Funnily, one lady who was with the ﬁ  lm board, landed up in my room with 
a doctor. I sheepishly told them that now I was better. Hopefully, when she reads this she shall realise how pivotal this day of work in Kenya was to 3 Idiots.
That entire day, the one day I managed to work on my script, away from all phone 
calls and distractions, I sat in my hotel room thinking about the story that I need to introduce to bind the ﬁ  lm. That is when this thought about the bet between the 
rivals struck me. One friend goes away and then the other two search for him. For the audience, the binding factor would then be — do they ﬁ  nd this friend or not? 
If they do ﬁ  nd him, then what is the story of the friend? Why did he leave? Where 
did he go? Does he win the bet or does he lose? At every stage, these questions would be at the back of their minds. This desire and curiosity in the audience to get to the end of the ﬁ  lm is the backbone of a screenplay. If I were to remove 
this entire story from the screenplay, then the ﬁ  lm becomes just a story set in a 
college and you are not really looking forward to anything. I remember I called Abhijat from there and told him this idea and he loved it. The icing on the cake was Abhijat coming up with the imposter idea.
AJ: The imposter idea in the ﬁ  lm came from a real-life story. I knew a man 
(I cannot name him as he is someone from the industry) who actually did what the real Ranchoddas does in the ﬁ  lm. A man applies to FTII and gets through. He 
also applies to an engineering college and gets selected. He gets selected in many places. He is a brilliant guy. Of all the entrance exams he clears, he decides to enrol in the engineering college. This brilliant guy is our imposter’s friend. The imposter wants to study cinema so he takes his friend’s permission and impersonates him. He studies at FTII for three years posing as the brilliant guy who chose engineering. "
"326The imposter passes out of the Institute, joins the ﬁ  lm industry, changes back to 
his real identity and makes ﬁ  lms. This real-life story, which not too many people 
know about, inspired the whole Rancho-imposter track.
RH: We combined the search and the imposter tracks and got the story of the 
ﬁ lm. The binding thread which was missing to keep the narrative moving was now 
in place. This was probably one of the most critical of the challenges we faced in writing 3 Idiots.  
What according to you is the core of 3 Idiots?
AJ: The ﬁ  rst scene that we wrote for 3 Idiots  was the conversation between Boman 
and Aamir at Joy’s funeral. This scene was in a different form and shape the ﬁ  rst 
time we wrote it. On the night of the suicide, Rancho goes up to the tower in the campus, rings the bell, gathers the students and delivers a speech. But in this form, the scene became too dramatic, grim, and preachy. We worked for days to make it more real and yet retain the drama and impact. The scene you see in the ﬁ lm felt more natural so we changed the speech to a conversation at the funeral. 
We purposely chose to make the boy who commits suicide a Christian so that the funeral is set in a cemetery. The grey of the cemetery and the rain gave the scene the grim and colourless tone that we needed. This scene, according to me, is the core of 3 Idiots.  Why should people be killing themselves? There is something wrong 
with the system. Why is everyone running after grades and not knowledge? That is what the ﬁ  lm addresses and attacks.
VC: I agree with Abhijat. 3 Idiots  questions the system and its pitfalls. The pressure 
to chase grades leads students to give in to pursuits that might not be the ones of their choice and compels them to take the set and decided path to set and decided goals. This only leads to suicides or mediocrity. Chasing excellence is not encouraged. Excellence over success is a philosophy I have always followed which has led me to take some very irrational decisions that have made no business sense. But because the pursuit was for quality, in the long run, success came in leaps and bounds. 
It is a very personal ﬁ  lm. Not only does it embody a philosophy that is close 
to your heart but it heavily borrows from your lives as well. Which portions in the ﬁ  lm have been picked from your lives?
RH: There is a lot in the ﬁ  lm from the scenes to the quirks added to embellish 
characters to dialogues that we have taken from our lives. I used to know a guy "
"327called Prasan Jain in FTII who once had a bath at the entrance gate of the campus 
to make the faculty aware that there was an acute water shortage in the hostel. So Rancho bathing in the garden came from there. “Jahanpanah tussi great ho” is also 
borrowed from the Film Institute. We were ragged for an entire month after we joined. All throughout that month, if we spotted a senior, we had to pull down our pants, bend over, pat our butts, and say, “Jahanpanah tussi great ho. Tohfa kubool karo.”  
This practice was called Farshi. In my days at the Nagpur Medical College with my theatre buddies, I got to know about this guy who used to slip magazines under the doors of other students to distract them during exams. The competition there was so ﬁ  erce that people resorted to some really desperate things. The conversation 
between Farhan and his father is again inspired by the conversation I had with my father which I have mentioned in detail in the introduction to this book. 
AJ: I have already told you about the impostor story. Apart from the search for the 
third friend and the imposter track, the third primary element in the story is the bet between Chatur and Rancho. This bet signiﬁ  es the clash of rival ideologies. We 
got the idea for this from an anecdote from Vinod’s initial years in the industry. After the trial of one of the ﬁ  lms made by a big Bollywood producer, Vinod hitched a 
ride with him in his posh car to be dropped to the nearest bus stop. The producer asked Vinod what he thought about the ﬁ  lm. Vinod launched into shredding the 
screenplay bit by bit and let the man know without mincing words that the ﬁ  lm 
was utter rubbish. The gentleman turned around and said, “Jadd vaddi gaadi lenga 
na tadd dekhanga tu kaisi picture banayenga”  (When you get used to riding in a big 
car, then we will see the kind of ﬁ  lms you make). The producer’s point was simple: 
when you get used to the luxuries, it is what works at the box ofﬁ  ce that takes 
precedence over the quality of cinema. Vinod got out of the car and swore that this is something he would never adhere to. He was clear from the beginning that the ball game was cinema and not money. If you got the former right, then the latter would follow. This clash of philosophies, of thought, money versus good cinema was the trigger for the bet between Rancho and Chatur. The Rancho “deﬁ  nition 
of books and the machine” scene is my gift to Raju’s son Veer. Raju was helping Veer with his homework. One of the questions in the assignment was: Why do we celebrate Good Friday? Veer’s answer to that was “to commemorate the resurrection of Christ.” Raju wanted to know if Veer knew the meaning of this answer. To his surprise, Veer did not. Raju launched into explaining it to him and then asked Veer to write the answer the way he had understood it. But Veer was adamant that it had to be written only in the manner that he had written it or his teacher would "
"328not be happy. Easy or uncomplicated language and, most importantly, veering away 
from the expected and accepted form of the answer was not an option. Raju was very bafﬂ  ed and concerned about this. He told me this story over the phone and 
it became the genesis of the Rancho-Professor ‘deﬁ  nition-of-machine’ face-off. 
The scene where Rancho, Farhan, and Raju go to Farhan’s house after the Director 
sends the warning letter to both Raju and Farhan’s parents is also inspired from two different incidents that happened in my life and Raju’s. Once, I had met a lady who was furious with her daughter. The daughter was a bright girl but the lady was yelling at her because she had scored 91 per cent instead of 94 per cent. The 3 per cent drop was unacceptable. The insanity of this mad race for marks left me amused and disturbed at the same time. When we were writing this scene, I really wanted to incorporate this. While at FTII, Raju with his Institute friends used to travel to Mumbai often over the weekends. On one such weekend, a friend of his invited them to his house for dinner. They all landed up at his place eager to devour the free food so looked forward to in those money-strapped college days. The friend who invited them and his mother had had a big ﬁ  ght. They sat in silence waiting 
for the announcement that the food is ready. After two hours, the mother got up and told the boys, “Beta agli baar aaoge to khaana zaroor kha kar jaana.”  Raju still 
remembers this because it was close to midnight when they were asked to leave and they were famished with barely over twenty rupees between all of them. 
The watch track between Pia and Rancho again came from an anecdote that Vinod 
had told me about ... 
VC: See I told you I cannot remember half the things. Abhijat has been gifted with 
a photographic memory. A relative of mine was working in the Gulf and was very well off. I was not doing that well then. During one of his visits, he was ﬂ  aunting 
his watch which cost a couple of lakhs. I heard him out and then exclaimed that there must be something wrong with his watch. He was taken aback and frantically examined his expensive watch. There was nothing wrong with it according to him so he asked me to explain myself. “Aapki ghadi itni mehngi hai aur meri sirf do sau 
rupyaye ki lekin phir bhi time same dikhateen hein”  (your watch is very expensive 
and mine costs only Rs 200 but both of them tell the same time), was my reply which left him speechless. 
Rancho propels the story forward. He illustrates the philosophy of the ﬁ  lm. A 
lot of people felt that his character does not have an arc in the ﬁ  lm. Rancho "
"329enters the story, preaches, and then leaves. He is too perfect. How did Rancho as 
a character evolve and did you have any fears and apprehensions that he might appear to be more ﬁ  ction than real as he began to take shape?
RH: The backbone of Rancho’s character which also separates him from everybody 
else is his lack of fear. He is a brilliant, free-spirited, and honest boy who is chasing what he is interested in most. Probably a person without fear has become unfathomable today so Rancho might seem unreal to some but to me he is very real. My ﬁ  rst thoughts on Rancho were that he is a boy from a village who has had 
no experience with formal education so he does not know the fear of teachers. He speaks to them as he speaks to everyone. I could have dwelled on his childhood and background a little more in the ﬁ  lm to bring this to the fore but I eventually 
felt that it was not necessary. Rancho lives by his philosophy and his beliefs. He makes choices which are absurd conventionally but he is not here to conform and he does not feel the need to. 
VC: Why does he appear superhuman? It was very easy for Raju, Abhijat, and 
me to ﬂ  esh out Rancho as we understand him completely. In fact, I see a lot 
of myself in Rancho. There are just too many similarities. I was always a topper in my school. I remember being thrown out of class because I dared to ask my teacher who Hamlet was. In college, I found BA very boring so I used to attend MA classes and I even studied the books prescribed for MA Economics. In my BA exams, I scored only 55 per cent. I was a consistent topper with scores usually ranging between eighties and nineties. I was sure that there was a mistake in the way I had been marked. I asked for a recheck and realised that the objections to some of the answers stemmed from the fact that I did not follow the pattern of writing the expected answers. I was quoting writers and theories, with all due respect, which were out of the purview of my teacher. Therefore, when I took my ﬁ  nal BA exams, 
I wrote all my references with the page numbers and the titles of the books and the authors. This is how I topped my BA exams. What surprised and bafﬂ  ed me 
though was the resistance of the educators to reward inventiveness. This reluctance and rigidity is steeped in our education system. You would be surprised to know that FTII had failed me. I was thrown out without a diploma. Then my student ﬁ lm, Murder At Monkey Hill, won the National Award and was also nominated 
for an Oscar. The moment I won the National Award, FTII appointed me as a member of their governing council. In this capacity, I spoke out against the staff as I was aware of everything that goes on there. The staff protested against me and said that I couldn’t be on the governing council because I had failed. The "
"330FTII management had to pass me then and I got my diploma. They had failed 
me because they wanted me to take a lot of exams, some of which I thought were completely ridiculous. For example, they wanted us to submit a feature ﬁ  lm script 
which I never did. The reason for that was simple. I felt we were not yet trained to do this. I protested against these unfair practices. It gives me no pleasure to say this but I did not have any teacher to look up to, and at that stage of your life, a guiding force can be such a boon. These experiences and the lack of guidance became my reason to back talent. I am passionate about doing this because I never had that privilege. I learnt the English language at the age of 16 (as late as that) and what am I doing now? I am making a ﬁ  lm in Hollywood. Even now, I have a 
problem understanding my actors and I ask them to talk slowly because it is tough for me to understand their accents. 
I can draw many parallels but the point I am making is that Rancho is not an 
unbelievable, ﬁ  ctional, larger-than-life character. He is probably someone who is a 
little tough to understand in this world because he does not conform. We are so happy sitting back and accepting whatever is doled out that anyone who questions, is considered an aberration.
AJ: While writing, we did not look at Rancho as a character in the ﬁ  lm but as the 
hero of the ﬁ  lm and he has been written like that, though he is neither superhuman 
nor a comic book hero. He has the attributes of a hero and it would be dangerous to pretend otherwise. He is an uninhibited free spirit with insatiable curiosity and genuine queries. He does not operate with arrogance or cockiness and Aamir has also played him with that inherent earnestness. But it would be incorrect to say that he does not have an arc in the ﬁ  lm or a journey. His journey in the ﬁ  lm starts 
from Joy’s suicide. He would not have taken on the system had he not seen that a perfectly wonderful boy was driven to suicide because of the mechanical, unthinking, ruthless system education has been reduced to. This stirs something inside him that he cannot ignore. A clear inspiration and inﬂ  uence here was the ﬁ  lm Deewar  (1975). 
Amitabh Bachchan is a daily wage worker at the dockyard. All workers there have to pay extortion money to Peter, the local goon. One man refuses to pay this and he is killed by the goons. The death of this innocent person changes Amitabh. He decides to ﬁ  ght back. “Raheem Chacha ab woh hoga jo 25 saal mein nahin hua. 
Agle hafte se ek aur coolie inn darindon ko hafta nahin dene wala hai”  (Something 
that has not happened in 25 years will happen now. Next week one more worker will not pay the extortion money to the goons) , goes the famous dialogue. Without 
this death which changes him, Amitabh would have remained just a worker content "
"331to earn his daily wages. This incident, its futility and cruelty, changes him. While 
writing Rancho, Raju and I had discussed this scene from Deewar . Therefore, Joy’s 
suicide is a turning point in Rancho’s life. This is his journey. And in the course of his own journey, he changes lives including his own. 
Like Rancho, Virus’s character must have been a challenge. How did you 
achieve balance there? 
RH: During Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. , we were shooting a scene where Boman was 
to deliver a speech to the students. He improvised and added in the speech that a doctor should be dispassionate towards his patients. He must maintain an emotional distance to give him perspective. The exact line was: “Agar mein apni family par operate 
karoonga to mere haath kampenge.” While scripting this, my debate with Boman was 
that this argument is so logical and valid that it completely justiﬁ  es Dr. Asthana’s 
character. It makes my hero look weak. Boman looked at me and said that this was my problem and not his. As an antagonist, he must have a point of view and if that point of view weakens the protagonist, then the director has to make the protagonist stronger. This has stayed with me since then. I have consciously applied this while constructing the characters in my ﬁ  lms. This helps in creating characters 
that are real and not one dimensional. Therefore, Virus despite his quirks has a ring of reality. His intention is not to go out there and harm students. He believes that life is a race and if you don’t run fast enough, you would be left behind. This is his point of view and he is unwavering in his belief. 
The ﬁ  lm starts with Farhan abandoning a ﬂ  ight that has already taken off. But it 
was a long process before you arrived at this opening for the ﬁ  lm. In the earlier 
drafts I read, several approaches were tried including the one where you were even contemplating bringing in Amitabh Bachchan as the narrator. How did you reach this opening scene and why was this scene the most appropriate according to you? 
RH: The starting point is always tough. The idea was to set up an extraordinarily 
large activity which Farhan has to abandon at the very mention of Rancho. This was done to establish the importance of Rancho in Farhan’s life.
AJ: Though we went along with the airplane scene to open the ﬁ  lm, I do have an 
alternate scene that happens to be my favourite. Given a chance, I would still do that instead of this. In my favoured beginning, Farhan is a linguist and is in the middle of a conversation between two Heads of State at the UN. He is the interpreter. He "
"332leaves this session to meet Rancho and these two men are left in the lurch. There 
is a lot of comedy that emerges from linguistics but we did not have enough time to develop it so we went along with the airplane scene. The airplane scene was also more dramatic. But these things are a matter of exploration. One explores multiple possibilities and then chooses the one that best works for the ﬁ  lm. 
Joy’s suicide was a critical point of debate. There are drafts that had it and 
several that did not. Its inclusion was probably most ﬁ  ercely debated in the 
entire screenplay. It was felt that this was too dark an incident for this ﬁ  lm or 
that it might dilute the revelation of Virus’s son’s death being a suicide. What was the thought behind the suicide scene and the reason for placing it within 20 minutes of getting into the ﬁ  lm?
VC: There was a lot of back and forth that happened over this. I had serious 
doubts about whether we should include this or not. But what convinced me was that this gave motivation to Rancho’s character. Raju took it a step further by adding a montage and a voice-over at the editing stage. There is a small montage with Farhan’s voice-over talking about Rancho and his quirky personality and from there the voice-over says, “Ek aur tha bilkul Rancho jaisa.”  And we cut to Joy. This 
voice-over that Raju introduced at the editing table, integrated the Joy track into the script. Otherwise, it would have been too much of a jump. It also illustrated that a brilliant guy like Rancho can go one way or the other. He can either become Phunsukh Wangdu or become so dejected by seeing mediocrity ﬂ  ourish around him 
that he gives up on life. 
RH: Joy’s suicide was thrown out and brought back innumerable times. Abhijat 
and I were very keen to keep it as we felt that the conﬂ  ict in the ﬁ  lm would start 
from there, otherwise it would just be a fun ﬁ  lm without anything substantial in 
it. Vinod and Aamir felt that it should not be there. They thought that it was too dark and grim. It was a jarring inclusion in the ﬁ  lm. But Abhijat and I were 
convinced that this had to be there. This went on for a long time. In fact, we only got it back into the script a month before the shoot started (September 2008). But the debate over it continued and then ﬁ  nally the montage and the voice-over 
during the edit, settled the matter. Earlier, the Rancho montage was not there in the ﬁ  lm. We had not even planned to keep it. Nevertheless, I shot it. Simply, so 
that if I ever felt like reviving it, then it could be done. The feedback after the ﬁ rst screening of the ﬁ  lm we organised for a sample audience revealed that Rancho 
being a mad genius was not coming across. I added the montage then and, linking "
"333it with Joy’s introduction by that voice-over, made Joy both integral to the plot 
and also lent him credibility.
AJ: Joy’s suicide is the spine of the ﬁ  lm. The second-half revelations are climatic 
devices. But Joy’s suicide is what makes Rancho realise that pressure to perform is the killer and it has to be fought. It is this belief that takes Rancho’s character and the story forward. Otherwise, why is he doing the things that he is doing? The ﬁ  rst half of the ﬁ  lm would become insubstantial if we took out the suicide. The challenge was to put this thing that worries us about the system right on top so that we know what Rancho is ﬁ  ghting, and the ﬁ  lm is saved from sinking under 
the weight of this intense scene.
The interval point is a bit of a shock. The tone of the scene and the treatment 
are unlike the rest of the ﬁ  lm. There were other interval points discussed as 
well before arriving at this one. How did this come about? 
RH: I wanted the fact that Rancho is an imposter to be revealed earlier in the ﬁ  lm. 
I felt if we stretched revealing this till the interval, then it would seem that this very rich kid had come into a college and was having fun. I felt that the audience needed to be told as quickly in the ﬁ  lm as possible that he was an imposter because 
it would get the audience to feel for him. So in the earlier drafts, we came out of the ﬂ ashback one more time in the ﬁ  rst half to reveal that Rancho was not actually 
Rancho but an imposter. Then we went back into the ﬂ  ashback and there was a 
different interval point (Farhan and Raju discovering that Pia is getting married being one of the options considered). But after a lot of thought and work on the script, I felt that the interval would be a great point to reveal that Rancho was not Rancho but an imposter. Sometimes, I still feel that it might have been better to reveal this earlier even though what we eventually put in the ﬁ  lm is a great interval 
point. In the end, these are choices that one makes. So once it was settled that this was going to be the interval point, we narrated it to Vinod. He suggested that we add the element of the college photograph having a different face on Rancho. This appealed to me as it enhanced the scene. 
VC: Unlike the West, Indian cinema does not follow the three-act structure which is 
a two-act deal. It is a very unusual way of watching movies. No one else across the world watches ﬁ  lms like this — you see one part of the ﬁ  lm, break for samosa s and 
chai, then you watch the rest of the ﬁ  lm. This makes the interval point extremely 
critical. Therefore, one must invest a lot of thought in where the break would happen. In this ﬁ  lm, my thought process was focussed on the level of interest of "
"334the audience when they would go and buy their popcorn. Basically, their eagerness 
to come back to ﬁ  nd out what happens next in the ﬁ  lm is vital. When I made 
the suggestion, I did not think that Raju would retain it. It lends a thriller-like quality to the twist. I felt that the audience would enjoy the suspense. The ﬁ  rst 
time I told Raju, he said he liked it but I do not believe anything Raju says in the evening. It is an age-old joke between us that I am the ‘in-the moment guy’ and he is the ‘next morning guy’. He likes to mull over and think over all the options. He makes up his mind only after that. So I always go with what Raju feels about things the next morning and not on the evening that they are suggested. I am happy that he retained it.
The ﬁ  lm initially ended with these people ﬁ  nding Rancho teaching in Ladakh 
in a school, leading a simple happy life doing what he loves doing. Phunsukh Wangdu was not in the ﬁ  lm at all. How did the idea of Phunsukh Wangdu 
fall into place? 
RH: Yes, that is true. Phunsukh Wangdu was not in the ﬁ  lm earlier. The ﬁ  lm 
ended with Farhan, Raju, and Pia reaching Ladakh and discovering that Rancho teaches in this fascinating little school and that is his success. Whatever he wanted to do, he did it. But we felt that maybe the audience would not understand this. They would probably say that “yaar khush to hain, lekin paise to kam kamaata hai 
na” (He might be happy but he earns very little money). We felt that to make the 
audience understand, we had to show him to be successful in the conventional way. This is the reason we added the Phunsukh Wangdu, coveted-scientist angle and backtracked to plant him in the ﬁ  lm. This is where Chatur’s quest emerged. 
He was shown to be looking for someone in the entire ﬁ  lm and at the end the 
man he is searching for is Rancho. The idea was to show a man living a simple life out of choice. Rancho has the option of signing a deal with anyone and raking in millions but he has chosen to do differently. We felt this would help the audience understand things better. 
Another reason was that we kept feeling that the climax was not great. It seemed 
that our climax was the delivery and then we were just wrapping up the ﬁ  lm in 
Ladakh. It felt weak. We, however, were doing a lot of things in Ladakh. First, we were showing an unusual school. As Farhan, Raju, and Pia enter the school, they see (an entire scene was there intially) that a race is going on, kids are running and one kid falls down. Instead of carrying on, all the kids run back to pick him up and then proceed to ﬁ  nish the rest of the race. These guys look at each "
"335other and say that this can only be Rancho’s school. Chatur’s electrocution scene 
initially had Millimeter in it. So all this material was there but these pieces were not coming together to result in a spectacular end to the ﬁ  lm. When we found 
Phunsukh Wangdu, things started falling into place. But to clean this up and to get it all together at the end took us a lot of time. Finally, it evolved to become a big twist at the end.
We solved the Phunsukh Wangdu riddle in our heads in Goa. Abhijat was on 
a writing visit to Mumbai. I received a call to attend the Film Festival in Goa (IFFI, end 2007). We decided to travel to Goa for two days on this pretext. Any reason to get away from Mumbai and write. We stayed at the same hotel as the one where we had shot the Lage Raho  song with the old people. Abhijat got very 
excited about it. He has this fascination for revisiting places that have a context. Except for the chief minister’s party the night we had arrived, we did not attend the festival at all. We took a long walk on the beach the day we arrived and Phunsukh Wangdu fell into place. It was quite magical and we were very happy with the climax after that. 
Phunsukh Wangdu, the real identity of Rancho, is revealed at the end. The 
point of revelation that Rancho is actually Phunsukh Wangdu is something you battled with for over a year. What made you decide the ﬁ  nal route?
RH: This was a tough one to decide. We were unsure of this right up till the day 
before we shot the scene. Abhijat and I felt that it should be revealed the moment the friends reunite, before Chatur’s arrival. By doing this, we would have revealed this to the audience that Rancho was Phunsukh Wangdu, the man Chatur was chasing and Chatur’s dialogues and demeanour with Rancho after this revelation would become even more hilarious to the audience as they would know that he would be in for a real shock when he found out that Rancho is Phunsukh. But both Aamir and Madhavan were of the view that the revelation should happen at the end so that the ﬁ  lm ends on a high note. They felt that revealing it earlier would weaken 
this dramatic twist. This is when the tussle started. Abhijat and I resisted for a long time but Aamir and Madhavan were so vehement and insistent that it became a question in our minds also. When I was in Ladakh for the shoot, I started to feel that maybe their suggestion holds some weight. Maybe the surprise at the end would be a great way to end the ﬁ  lm. So I changed it and rewrote it in Ladakh a 
day before the shoot. Frankly, I still don’t know which route was better. Actually, it is a matter of interpretation. Both routes are correct in their own way. "
"336Chatur’s speech scene is a complete departure from the Raju Hirani sensibility 
and the overall VCF sensibility. There were also varied opinions about the shloka  at the end of the speech. Were there any apprehensions at the time of 
writing this? 
RH: I was aware that what we were doing with this ﬁ  lm, we had not done before. 
There was also complete awareness of the fact that we might be panned for using what people might label as toilet humour. There are ragging scenes with boys in their underwear. The language is of a certain quality and other things as well, but while writing, we realised that the campus world we had created would look completely false if we didn’t use the language, the irreverence of youth, and the whole college milieu while creating it. This is the way this world is and, therefore, our job was to stay true to this world. This was the necessity of this world. This scene we cracked when Abhijat and I were in Columbus, Ohio (April 2007). The decision that Rancho will change Chatur’s speech was already in place but we had not worked out the details of the scene yet. We decided to make it more challenging for ourselves. It would have been easy to change the entire speech but if only a few words were to be changed, then it would have been tough. Therefore, the challenge was to write a speech that, if kept in its original format, sounded great but if you were to change just a few words in it, then it would become completely different. We struggled for many days to ﬁ  nd the right words. We had thought about many 
words and many ideas but nothing was good enough. We wanted it to rhyme too. One day, we were out for a drive and we hit upon ‘chamatkar’  and ‘balatkar’ . But 
after using this a few times, we felt that we needed a change because carrying an entire speech only on a single word change might get monotonous so the hunt for the second word started. I was in Ohio then, visiting Abhijat. We were out for a walk when the second word struck us (‘dhan’  and ‘sttan’ ). Abhijat’s daughter 
Anoushka (age 12) was also with us. While Abhijat and I were talking, we cracked this and Abhijat almost fell down laughing. We were both in splits but we could not share this with Anoushka. 
The shloka  at the end is another story. It was not there in the scene. While writing 
the screenplay, we had rented a small farmhouse in Pune where we used to go and write very often. During one of our writing sojourns in this farmhouse, in some other context and not in the context of this speech scene, Abhijat told me this shloka . I laughed to the point of tears. I decided there and then that I wanted it 
in the speech scene and it was incorporated at the end of the scene. Since Chatur already had this trait of farting and is called Silencer by everyone, the shloka  ﬁ tted "
"337in perfectly. But Vinod felt we should take it out. Later, even Abhijat felt the same. 
But I was very keen to retain it. During the edit, Vinod said that the scene was too long and we should take out the shloka  but Vir (Vinod’s elder brother) who 
saw the scene was in splits and didn’t want me to touch it. I really wanted it to be in the ﬁ  lm so I was happy that eventually everyone came around to it.
VC: (Blushing) I was very shocked by that shloka.  But Vir loved it and I tested it 
through screenings on other people and they died laughing too. My objection had nothing to do with sensibility because as Raju said, one has to adopt the sensibility of the ﬁ  lm and not some general sensibility. Therefore, there were no sensibility 
issues here. I just felt that the scene was getting too long and might be a bit of a stretch. My biggest concern is always that the audience should not be bored.
AJ: The speech scene was hilarious but I must say that it was not in the script just 
as a set piece for humour. It is the illustration and the turning point for the clash of the ideologies which is the key element in the ﬁ  lm. Rancho protests against rote 
learning that our education system encourages. He is completely against it. The ‘deﬁ nition of a machine’ scene introduces that. The speech scene illustrates the ills 
of following blindly without understanding the meaning of things. It shows that Chatur is end-oriented whereas Rancho worries about the journey. With the speech, the battle of the philosophies becomes an open battle. Right after this scene, we have the scene where Chatur and Rancho lay a bet to meet after ten years to see who is more successful. The speech scene lent to the progression of this theme in the ﬁ lm.
The shloka  at the end is another story. I knew that if I told Raju this, he would 
immediately want it in the ﬁ  lm and that is what happened. Later in the edit, I too 
was unsure about it like Vinod and like he said, it was not because of any sensibility issues. It was because I felt that Rancho probably would not meddle with the speech to this extent. He would change just two words and that would be enough for him to drive the point home. But I am glad that Raju and Vir prevailed in the end because the shloka  is the pièce de résistance of the speech scene (laughing).
The delivery scene has invited a lot of mixed reactions from a section of the 
audience. I remember you telling me that you began this ﬁ  lm by ﬁ  rst deciding 
on the climax because that was a huge challenge you faced while writing Lage 
Raho?  Frankly, what were you people thinking when you decided on this as 
the concluding episode in the ﬁ  lm?"
"338RH: The origin of this scene is from Munna Bhai M.B.B.S . I had thought of this 
scene where Munna gets admission into medical college. He has only done this to spite Asthana. He has no other motivation to study at a medical college other than his disdain for Asthana. One night, he is roaming the streets with Circuit. They are drunk. Munna is wearing the doctor’s white jacket so that he feels like a doctor. There is a ‘Mumbai bandh’  that day. Both of them are crossing a chawl . 
A boy comes running out of the chawl  and is hunting for an auto-rickshaw. His 
mother is pregnant and her waters just broke. He has to rush her to the hospital or ﬁ nd a doctor. He spots Munna and drags Munna into the chawl  because he 
thinks that Munna is a doctor. These guys have no idea what to do but somehow they get through the delivery. The idea behind the scene was to get Munna to realise the value and responsibilities of doctors. The moment he held the newborn, this would have hit him. Now, he would really want to study medicine. The script underwent many changes and this route was abandoned. I had told Abhijat about it. While writing 3 Idiots,  like I told you earlier, we were determined to 
ﬁ rst decide the climax. Abhijat and I talk a lot when we are writing so this is 
one of the scenes I mentioned again and Abhijat said, “Why don’t we use this here?” Rancho could apply engineering for the delivery. This thought combined with a short story I had read somewhere about a man who used to talk to his baby while he was still in his mother’s womb, connected with Pia’s sister and ‘Aal izz well’, our climax, started taking shape. Then, we spent a lot of time with gynaecologists to make it authentic. It became a big joke in ofﬁ  ce. Whenever 
Vinod used to come to ofﬁ  ce and ask for us, he was told that we had gone to 
the gynaecologist. Everyone teased us endlessly about our visits to gynaecologists. One of my friends had introduced us to Dr. Sejal Desai who became our guide while writing this scene. She told us about the various procedures by which a baby could be delivered. The only procedure which could be combined with engineering was the suction method. A lot of people think that this cannot happen but the scene is totally authentic and it is possible to deliver a baby like this. At every step, we consulted the doctors and, in a way, we wrote the scene with them. A lot of work, a lot of research, and a lot of time were spent on this. Even during the shoot, the doctors were there and constantly monitoring what was happening and how it was being depicted. This is not one of those up in the air, fantasy things that we have put in the ﬁ  lm for the sake of a great climax. 
You have often referred to the three scenes that constitute this continuous chunk 
in the ﬁ  lm as the soul of 3 Idiots:  Raju’s job interview, Farhan’s conversation "
"339with his father, and Rancho breaking down when they come and tell him 
about their triumphs. These scenes had several rewrites before they took the ﬁ nal form in which they are in the ﬁ  lm. Why do you feel that this chunk is 
the essence of 3 idiots?
RH: These are the moments in the ﬁ  lm I am most attached to and they make me 
very emotional. Even while narrating these scenes, I would often get choked with emotion. In a way, I feel, they are the crux of the ﬁ  lm. I have always been fond 
of an underdog succeeding. I like hope. I see victory in hope. Be happy, go and do whatever you want without fear. This is what one wants to say about life. We had to put a lot of work into these scenes. For example, a lot of back and forth happened in order to elevate the interview scene to the level we aimed to take it to. It was written and rewritten several times. Initially, Raju Rastogi was only saying things about fear, god, and superstition and he used to get the job. I felt that the scene was ﬂ  at. It lacked punch and impact. Then we hit upon the ‘attitude’ angle 
which transformed the scene completely. 
How this happened is quiet remarkable as well. I had read a chicken soup story 
about a small boy who is asked by his teacher to write an essay about what he wants to become. The boy writes his essay describing his dream, of owning a ranch one day with thousands of horses. The teacher is not impressed and tells him to alter this unrealistic aim to a more practical one. He tells him to aspire for something more achievable as the boy comes from too poor a background to ever achieve this dream. He also threatens to fail him in the assignment if it is not altered. The boy comes the next day and again submits the same assignment. The teacher is furious now. He tells him that he will surely get an F on this assignment. The boy says, “You can keep your F Sir and I will keep my dream.” I was very moved by this story. I narrated it to Abhijat and was itching to use it somewhere. For a year, the subconscious thought was to apply this somewhere in the script but we could never ﬁ nd the right moment or place for it. In the end, in a different form, it was used in 
this scene. I think the thought here is of preserving what deﬁ  nes you. Once you are 
willing to give that up, then that is the ﬁ  rst step towards losing your identity and 
your dreams. Farhan’s confrontation with his father, apart from writing it, was also not an easy scene to execute. Even in the writing of it, initially, I was not entirely satisﬁ ed with the trigger that makes the father come around. I felt maybe Farhan 
has to say more, do more. Something here was not working for me. Also, I was very unsure about executing the father’s change of heart. The tone, the blocking, the pitch, everything had to be perfect for this scene to work. I expressed all of this to "
"340Abhijat. I was very restless about this. He reassured me and said that he would do 
something. He wrote this entire scene on his own and mailed it to me. 
What clicked was this gesture he suggested for Farhan. The father gets very angry 
during their conversation and comes and sits down on a chair. Farhan goes up to his father and kneels down before him and talks to him. It was this act of deference and total submission that elevated the scene. If you noticed, the tone of the scene is not of rebellion but of persuasion. Farhan is asking for permission; he is not informing his parents. He is appealing to them to let him live his dreams. If they would not have come around, he would have sacriﬁ  ced his dream.
Lastly, the scene where Rancho breaks down was not there in the ﬁ  lm earlier. If 
you look at it, there was no need for it technically because after these two scenes (Raju’s job interview and Farhan’s conversation with his father), we could have gone straight to the barber shaving off Virus’s moustache as he had lost the bet. But I have always felt that when there is an emotion this potent, it has to play out in full. You need to see the aftermath, otherwise it appears abrupt. The trick to pacing a ﬁ  lm is as much in speeding it up as in slowing it down and letting it 
breathe when the screenplay demands it. I wrote this scene to bring the emotion in the earlier scenes to its rightful conclusion. 
But when we shot the scene that in its original form had Raju and Farhan come 
and hug Rancho and he breaks down, I was not satisﬁ  ed. I called Abhijat and asked 
him about what he thought of them taking off their pants and saying, “Jahanpanah, 
tussi great ho,”  to Rancho. Earlier this was to happen right at the end when they 
reunite in Ladakh. Abhijat liked the idea and we changed it on location. We removed it from the climax of the ﬁ  lm and brought it up to this point. Instead of 
these boys, now Chatur takes off his pants at the end and says, “Jahanpanah, tussi 
great ho. Tohfa kabool karo.” 
There seems to be a design to the way 3 Idiots  has been written. The drama 
is carefully balanced with laughter. The audience does not cave in under the weight of any scene. Was this intentional?
RH: This is an inherent trait in all my ﬁ  lms. If I had my way, I would package 
everything with laughter. I believe in the world that I create in my ﬁ  lms. One 
can choose to be cynical or one can choose to look at things differently. If you really analyse the emotional, dramatic scenes, you will notice that they incite tears of happiness and hope and not of despair and loss except for Joy’s suicide. I hate "
"341sadness in ﬁ  lms. So more than design, this happens because of the way we look at 
the world: our beliefs, experiences, and ideas.
AJ: I agree with Raju but it is still gratifying to see that after every dramatic scene, 
we managed to diffuse the tension by making people laugh within minutes. In terms of craft, this is a massive challenge. It can ruin a ﬁ  lm if not done seamlessly and 
effortlessly. Our inspiration for this was The Lion King. Mufasa’s  death is this dark, 
hard-hitting, unforgettable, and memorable moment but exactly two minutes later you are transported to the world of ‘Hakuna Matata’. We shed tears with Simba, we are moved and stirred but two minutes later we are singing  ‘Hakuna Matata’ 
with joy and hope. Most screenplays would dwell on an event like Mufasa’s death for at least ten minutes. 
Your (Raju and Abhijat) collaboration began during Lage Raho Munna Bhai.  
It continued through 3 Idiots  and now you are writing another ﬁ  lm together. 
It is a delicate relationship where many things have to come together for it to become productive. How does it work for both of you?
AJ: Raju and I share the same sensibility. Our approaches, our ideas, the path 
that we want to take, are all the same. When Raju and I write, the path that we follow is completely non-linear. We start with writing the scenes that we value. It is a nightmare later to string them together and beat them into a narrative. But the magic of this method is that once you do this, you have, as writers, followed such an unknown path that the audience has no chance of second guessing the trajectory of the ﬁ  lm. So we ﬁ  rst follow the magic and pen down what we treasure 
most and then apply reason and bind it together. It is a rare and wonderful meeting of minds.
RH: I spend more time with him than I do with my wife. I wish he were a woman 
(laughs). Apart from him being a good writer and our sensibilities being the same (we are both from small towns and we have shared similar experiences; our reference points are the same), the quality I most enjoy and admire in Abhijat is that he does not defend his scenes. Most writers spend a huge chunk of their time defending their scenes. If I want something done differently, he understands my point of view. This does not mean that he is not passionate about what he writes or does not believe in his scene but it simply means that he is ready to explore. He has a positive aura. Secondly, I don’t have to walk on eggshells with him. That is a huge 
relief. In cinema, you waste a lot of time, precious time, dealing with egos because "
"342everyone you are dealing with is an artist. You have to think of ways and means to 
convey your opinion without hurting people or offending them. This house-keeping I don’t have to do with him. I can say what I feel without hesitation and without any sugar-coating. It saves us a tremendous amount of time. And most importantly, Abhijat does not give up. We could have been through a million drafts but he does not get fatigued by the evolving screenplay. He keeps at it. I am the same soI know that this stems from tremendous passion. Even if the shoot is on and things need to be changed, he has that faith in me and I in him that if it makes the ﬁ  lm 
better, we will do whatever it takes. This synergy is rare. Before Abhijat and I started working together, I never thought that I would need a writing partner or I could work with a writing partner but now I feel it is essential to have one.
The process of screenwriting and directing holds such mystery that many ﬁ  nd it 
hard to ﬁ  gure out where to start. What would your suggestions be to students 
aspiring to write and direct their material? 
RH: I believe that formal education in some form is essential to an extent. One 
does not have to enrol in an institute or course necessarily but other modes of learning like reading, watching theatre and ﬁ  lms can help you gather the tools and 
grammar that will enable you to write and make ﬁ  lms. But what is most critical to 
preserve is the faculty to think from your heart. Once you get into theory which is important, we tend to lose the innocence with which ﬁ  lms were watched earlier. We 
tend to view them only with an eye on the craft: there comes the central conﬂ  ict; 
those are the hurdles in the plot; lensing just changed; and a crane was used for this shot, and so on, is what we start focussing on. We start viewing ﬁ  lms purely 
from the perspective of craft. The ability to think from the heart and appreciate a ﬁ lm honestly vanishes. For me, to keep this faculty to think from the heart alive 
is the biggest battle. This is what leads to honest work. The other thing is to try to bring in fresh ideas. It is very tough to do that these days but the effort should be there to achieve this.
AJ: I feel that novelty of idea is paramount. Anything you are writing or attempting 
to write should not have the sound of something that has been done a hundred times before. The approach that though it has been done before but I will write it so well that it will work, according to me, does not work. You need to feel strongly about the idea that you choose and you need to believe in it. It must sound unique to you to begin with. Once you have settled on the idea, the element of time comes in. A screenplay demands a lot of time and patience. The writing process, in case "
"343quality is the goal, cannot be rushed. Therefore, you must be prepared to devote 
that time. At least two to three years. Once these two commitments are made, then for the ﬁ  rst two or three months you must not write. You must mull over the idea. 
Where do I want to go with this thought? What am I trying to say? Who are the characters in my story? Why is what I am saying worth saying? Why should I be writing this at all? These are the questions you should spend time answering in these initial months. Once you have convincingly answered these for yourself, you should start the writing process. A good technique is to keep two screenplays going at the same time. It helps sometimes. You might love some moments but they don’t work for a screenplay so you can always put them in the other one you are working on or save them for some other story in the future. So you don’t hang on to your darlings. But more than two screenplays at a time is a distraction. 
VC: The only process and method I know is consistent, relentless, passionate, and 
focussed hard work. Let me tell you a secret. Talent, as is the popular belief, is not inborn. It is something you have to work for. If you work hard enough, you can achieve anything. That is the key to it all.

THINGS  OF BEAUTYTHINGS  OF BEAUTY
""
"A thing of beauty is a joy forever …
— John Keats
Praise this world to the Angel … show him
some simple thing, refashioned by age after age,till it lives in our hands and eyes as a part of ourselves.
— Rainer Maria Rilke
Three minutes of cinema time …
A young lady who hates her father’s archenemy and furiously confronts him must 
within the next three minutes break off her engagement with her ﬁ  ancé, fall 
hopelessly in love with the same archenemy, and convincingly fantasise singing a rain-drenched love song with him. 
The girl is Pia; the nemesis she must confront is Rancho; the ﬁ  ancé she must plunk 
is Suhas, the Price T ag;  and the song she must sing is ‘Zoobi Doobi’. 
The question is: How do we achieve this sea change within three minutes of cinema 
time?  
Raju and I ponder over this question in New York City over two cups of tea. We 
know with absolute certainty that we can’t spend a single extra minute garnishing the love story. Our screenplay, completed except for this one problem, is already half-an-hour longer than we would ideally want. And the placement of the love song is particularly precarious: around the 75th minute into the ﬁ  lm, a time when 
most people are itching to leave either for the restroom or for some popcorn. If the screenplay sags even for a second before the song, audiences the world over would "
"348end up using the song as a restroom break. And if they did so, they wouldn’t return 
from such a mass exodus in time for the interval point, the biggest  twist and the 
most crucial plot-point of the story. 
We can’t let them go for a break. Which means Pia must fall in love with her 
archenemy in no time at all. But how? 
In Shakespeare’s Richard III,  Princess Anne goes to slay her husband’s murderer 
Richard, only to get engaged to him in the same scene, mesmerised by his allure. Richard later boasts: “Was ever a woman in this humor wooed? Was ever a 
woman in this humor won?” I remind Raju of the scene. Raju wryly reminds me that 
we are not Shakespeare. Point taken. So how do lesser mortals achieve this effect? 
Through some mundane, everyday thing . Some simple object , refashioned age after 
age. In this case, it’s going to be Pia’s watch . 
In their ﬁ  rst meeting, Rancho had seen Pia being reprimanded by her brand-obsessed 
ﬁ ancé for wearing a cheap watch at her sister’s wedding. When we wrote that scene, 
we had not seen the potential of the watch as a leitmotif . Now, in New York City, 
where I have followed Raju from Columbus on the last leg of his US trip in the hope that we can crack the Pia-Rancho  track before his departure to India, we 
decide to play with the watch and see what happens. 
What happens is a little miracle that a screenwriter encounters once in about three 
or four years. 
Opening salvo with the watch: it helps Rancho deﬂ  ate Pia’s ﬁ  ancé with one swift 
‘demo’:  Rancho hides the expensive watch that the ﬁ  ancé has just bought for Pia 
and tells him that she has lost it. This simple ruse brings rushing to the fore all the maniacal materialism, brand-obsession, price-consciousness, and the sheer rudeness of the ﬁ ancé. Moments later, stunned and insulted, Pia breaks off the engagement. 
Salvo two: Rancho has vanquished Pia’s ﬁ  ancé but not yet won her over. It happens 
in an instant, through a single innocuous remark. He congratulates Pia for showing the courage in breaking off with her ﬁ  ancé and points out that “Ab tum jab chaho 
apni maa ki ghadi pehan sakti ho”  (Now you are free to wear your mom’s watch) . 
This single sentence causes an explosion in Pia’s cognitive universe. In a ﬂ  ash, it 
alters her perception, memory, reasoning, and ﬁ  nally her judgment. How does Rancho 
know that the cheap watch she was wearing at her sister’s wedding once belonged to her mother? Because he could reason that the bride’s sister, otherwise dressed opulently, "
"349could be wearing one object so humble only for its sentimental value. Ergo he 
possesses sensitivity and tenderness that she had never suspected he did!  
Salvo three: The next time Pia meets Rancho, she holds out her wrist — she is 
wearing her mother’s watch.  Without a single word, through the semiotics of that 
one gesture, she conveys to him that she has forgiven him his ruthless deconstruction and debunking of her father’s and her ﬁ  ancé’s philosophies, embraced his values and 
is now ﬁ  rmly in his camp. In fact, she loves him. 
Thus, the watch helps us tide over one of the trickiest plot points that had threatened 
to derail our screenplay. Even more importantly, it infuses Rancho’s character with one quality that sets him apart from almost all characters before him in Indian cinema — authenticity. When Pia’s ﬁ  ancé is ranting about the astronomical price of 
the lost limited edition watch, Rancho gently retorts, “Meri to dhai sau ki hai yaar, 
lekin time wohi batati hai”  (Mine is inexpensive, but shows the same time). [This 
is an incident that we borrowed almost verbatim from Vidhu Vinod Chopra’s life, when as a young and struggling student, he could not ignore the slight about his humble watch from an afﬂ  uent relative.] This remark by Rancho is emblematic of 
his authentic nature and the very ﬁ  rst overt declaration of one of his many priorities: 
value over price, passion over pragmatism, excellence over success, understanding over information, communication over jargon, education over training, knowledge over diploma, and a mother’s watch over a limited-edition watch! 
All we asked of the watch was to save us a few minutes. What it gifted us was the 
kernel, the essence, the very nucleus of the ﬁ  lm. 
Strangely, we stumbled on the extraordinary potential of objects  through a problem 
that we faced very early in the screenplay, a problem that is every writer’s nightmare: a big cliché. 
The scene: The Director’s motivational speech to the freshmen on their ﬁ  rst day 
at college. 
Audiences around the world have heard and witnessed such spiel a zillion times, 
ranging from the great bombast in Patton  and Full Metal Jacket  to the lamest 
offerings from the trashiest of campus ﬂ  icks. 
Tom Stoppard, the great English playwright, came to the rescue. Not in person, 
but in spirit — boleto  Chetana . Stoppard thrives on introducing bizarre objects into 
his plays and later providing perfectly plausible explanations for them. One of his "
"350plays begins with a man opening the door of his apartment with shaving foam on 
his face, a bow and an arrow in one hand and a tortoise in the other to ﬁ  nd a 
policeman carrying a bouquet of ﬂ  owers standing outside. Soon enough, Stoppard 
gives us an entirely convincing reason for this outlandish spectacle. Inspired by Stoppard’s virtuosity, the cuckoo’s nest , complete with the fake bird atop it,  was born. 
The Director carries this strange object in his hand as he strides down the imposing corridors. The audience wonders about the logic of this peculiar object, till in his speech, the Director links it with competition that abounds in nature: a koel kills 
off its competition by pushing the host bird’s eggs out of the nest. As the audience gets involved in the story of the koel and ruthless competition, we have successfully 
negated a big cliché. Later in the same scene, instead of ending the speech with rhetoric or polemics, we take it to its climax with another object: the Director takes out a gleaming astronaut’s pen,  holds it up enticingly as the ultimate trophy for the 
students. Through Rancho’s healthy disrespect for the pen, and his archrival Chatur’s salivating regard for it, we were able to immediately and wordlessly set up the clash between two conﬂ  icting philosophies: obsession with success versus excellence. Once 
again, an inanimate object was helping us not merely to scale over a plot hurdle but in intensifying the ﬁ  lm as a comedy of ideas. 
Since one speech was served so ably by two diverse objects, Raju and I intuitively 
grasped that inanimate objects would play a seminal role in the story. In fact, as I have lately grown fond of saying, they would form the DNA of the ﬁ  lm. 
For Lage Raho Munna Bhai , we had discovered about halfway through the scripting 
process that the DNA of the ﬁ  lm was ‘oolta kar’ or do the opposite — the principal 
of inversion. For constraints of space, I can only give one quick example of this. When Munna is asked how to deal with a boy who desecrated Gandhi’s statue, from behind him Bapu answers: “Give more stones to the lad, tell him to topple all my statues.” This is clearly inverse to the answer that the audience is likely to postulate in their heads and therefore highly intriguing because they cannot second guess what will follow. Throughout Lage Raho Munna Bhai , whenever in trouble, 
we had summoned this principal of inversion. 
For Broken Horses, another screenplay I co-authored with Vinod, the DNA is memory;  
the childhood memory of a mentally challenged character. Whenever faced with major dilemmas, he summons not his faculty of reasoning but the faculty of reminiscence: what his parents taught him when he was little. In every major dramatic scene, we found ourselves relying utterly on memory  for solutions. "
"351For 3 Idiots , which was being written at the same time as Broken Horses , we realised 
that the DNA was objects. Objects marked the comic and the tragic, the dramatic and the philosophical beats of the ﬁ  lm with equal felicity. To chronicle the genesis 
of each object that served us so valiantly for transfusing red corpuscles into our scenes would ﬁ  ll a book longer than the screenplay. But here is the briefest account 
of our extended encounter with things .
The Comic Objects
The empty gift envelopes,  the mounds of food on the plates  of three friends, and most 
crucially, the mint chutney  are irreplaceable for the comic ﬂ  avour of the scene where 
Rancho gatecrashes Pia’s sister’s wedding. Of these, the mint chutney proved to be a powerful motif. Rancho ﬁ  rst drops it on Suhas’s shoes to determine their price. 
We went on to use it in three more scenes:
A. In the song ‘Zoobi Doobi’ where Pia imagines Rancho as a chef eulogising 
the virtues of the “ever-useful mint chutney that, apart from being delicious, 
also reveals a man’s character.”  
B. The scene where a drunken Pia barges into Rancho’s room and he, scrupulously 
small town, offers her dhokla  with mint chutney to distract her from her 
amorous advances. This leads to the memorable lines about the menacing names of innocuous Gujarati food items like dhokla, fafda, thepla  that sound 
like missiles to Pia. 
C. The scene of Pia’s wedding, when to stop the groom from heading for the 
altar, Raju Rastogi irons his clothes with an iron drenched in mint chutney. As promised, the chutney reveals the groom’s character instantly as Pia hears him scream out the price of his ruined wedding dress. 
Our most innovative comic object, however, is not the mint chutney. The pride of 
that place must go to an object so humble, so self-effacing that most people would not even remember it — the heart-rate monitor  in the hospital where Raju Rastogi lay 
in a coma after his suicidal ‘high jump’. This object served an extraordinary purpose. It saved Reel No. 7 of the ﬁ  lm from becoming so grave, heavy, and weighty that 
it could have sunk the entire ﬁ  lm. This, by far, is our favourite reel of the ﬁ  lm. It 
starts with the Director’s brutal act of compelling Rastogi to type the letter of his own rustication — an act that drives Rastogi into attempting suicide and culminates, after Rastogi’s recovery, in the twin movement of Farhan convincing his father that "
"352he does not want to become an engineer and Rastogi successfully facing a crucial 
job interview. This reel is clearly the heart  of 3 Idiots.  The problem was that scene 
after overwhelmingly moving scene, this was also by far the grimmest, darkest, and the longest (about 20 minutes) reel of the ﬁ  lm. We desperately needed to bring 
some levity, some joy to this beat of the story. Since the searing dramatic scenes allowed no scope for comic maneuvering, we came up with what I consider to be the most daring and audacious tricks of our screenwriting careers — we decided to lace the musical interludes  of the song ‘Jaane Nahi Denge T ujhe’  with comedy. But 
hold on! Swanand Kirkere has written those stanzas so movingly and Sonu Nigam has sung them with such unbridled emotionalism that how the hell can we bring in comedy into the interludes? 
Well, with the help of the little heart-rate monitor.Knowing that Rastogi’s brain responds to voice despite the coma, Rancho begins to 
tell outrageous and funny lies to him to try and revive him. Though the idea was comic, we realised that it would fall ﬂ  at since the lies would not elicit a response 
from the coma-stricken Rastogi. This is where the heart-rate monitor stepped in. Whenever Rastogi responds to anything that is said, his heart rate increases and the graph on the monitor alters. The dance of this graph started drawing laughter from the audience at every screening. The more outrageous the lie or the action, the more vibrant the externalisation of Rastogi’s inner thoughts. When Rancho ﬁ nally utters the most outrageous lie that poor Farhan would marry Rastogi’s sister 
without any dowry, the seismic dance of the white graph reaches a frenzied climax. The next moment the coma-stricken patient’s right hand moves. Life returns to his limbs, hope returns to his friends’ hearts and we, the writers, about to lose our comic licenses for non-use, get a fresh lease of life. Thank you, monitor!  
Apart from these major objects, there were many minor ones that came ﬂ  eetingly 
into the ﬁ  lm to help us ﬁ  nd chuckles, guffaws, and occasionally, that big explosive 
theatre-shaking laughter that makes the years of the screenwriter’s toil totally worthwhile: the spoon at the end of the rod  that Rancho improvises to electrocute 
the urinating senior; the single grey hair  that is kneaded into the ﬂ  our as the friends 
are eating rotis at the Rastogi house; Chatur’s hand-crafted biscuits from San Francisco  
that he so jealously guards for Phunsukh Wangdu, the comic device that enabled us to weave in the Wangdu track without drawing attention to it; the urn of ashes  
that the friends so shockingly and irreverently waylay and through the threat of immersing the ashes in the sewer, blackmail the fake Rancho into revealing the secret "
"353of the real Rancho being an imposter, thus enabling us to make a long exposition 
dramatic and funny. Pia’s helmet  helped us negate the sentimentality and cliché of 
Rancho’s dream [ “Pia, tum roz dulhan ke costume mein scooter pe baith kar mere 
sapne mein aati ho. Ghoongat ki jagah apna helmet uthaati ho….”  (Every night you 
ride into my dreams on your scooter, dressed as a bride. Instead of the veil, you lift your helmet…) ] and last but not least, the two keys to the Director’s ofﬁ  ce that 
are ﬂ ung at Farhan, one by Rancho and the other by the Director, one from a dear 
friend and the other from a dreaded foe, one stolen and the other legitimate but both thrown at him with the same aim: to save a human life. 
The Dramatic Objects 
A chopper with a surveillance camera mounted atop,  rises in the air and soars. It 
seems to embody the joy and goodwill of the entire campus in its ﬂ  ight. With 
the crowd beneath giving it rousing cheers, it continues upwards like Shelley’s Skylark  — “Soaring doth thou sing, and singing ever soarest.”  Rancho, remote in his 
hand, guides this invention to the window of its originator, Joy Lobo, hoping to catch his astonishment and euphoria on the mounted camera … and Joy Lobo hangs from the ceiling fan, a failure in his own eyes. His most brilliant success, the ﬂ ying camera, hovers outside his window, recoding the inescapable evidence of 
his ﬂ ight from this world. 
This is the biggest turning point in the ﬁ  lm. From this point on, Rancho, though 
an imposter, living under an alias and hence keen on keeping a low proﬁ  le, takes 
off his gloves and takes on the system. 
I am ashamed to admit that for one full year, for the ﬁ  rst ﬁ  ve or six drafts of 
the screenplay, we had something as lame as sleeping pills as the means of Joy’s demise. Peel off a few drafts of the screenplay, and what you stare at is pure mediocrity! 
A few  rings, a wheelchair, a laptop, and a letter,  these simple objects provided us 
with the bulwark for the most important beat of the story in 3 Idiots — the twin 
movement where Raju Rastogi, a changed man after his suicide attempt, fearlessly faces a job interview and Farhan, unyielding but loving, wins his father’s blessings for leaving engineering and embracing photography. Without the aid of objects, the scenes would have needed so many lines of dialogue to convey the complex 
emotions that they would have degenerated into sermons. Objects helped us slash the dialogue and deepen the emotion. "
"354Before facing the job interview, Raju Rastogi takes off his lucky rings that embody 
all his superstitions and fears and discards them in a metallic bedpan.  CLANG! 
Wordlessly, with that mutinous clang, the hitherto weak man has trashed his old fearful self. Later, the wheelchair  is crucial to the scene when he faces the interview 
panel. More than what he has lost , the wheelchair represents what he has gained: 
“Dono taange tudvaake apne pairon pe khada rahena seekha hai” (It took two broken 
legs to get me up on my feet).  The same scene, without changing a single line 
of dialogue, with Rastogi sitting in an ordinary chair would never have had the same impact. 
A laptop versus a letter  — that is the essence of the encounter between Farhan 
and his father. The letter is Farhan’s dream, written ﬁ  ve years ago to his revered 
photographer requesting apprenticeship but never posted for fear of breaking his father’s heart. Rancho sends it out without Farhan’s knowledge and lo! the photographer answers, inviting Farhan to the Brazilian rainforest to work with him. Now Farhan stands at two divergent roads, one that leads him to engineering and the other to his passion, photography. Which one will he take? At this very moment, Farhan’s father is proudly showing his mother the brand new laptop, a gift for Farhan, in anticipation of a plush new engineering job. The laptop represents the recompense for all the sacriﬁ  ces and hardships that the father has undertaken for the education 
of his son and all his solid and conservative hopes of a good life for his son. In this sense, the laptop is the exact opposite of the sense of adventure, uncertainty and passion that the letter represents. The scene becomes the battleground for two disparate philosophies through two commonplace objects. When Farhan, without an ounce of anger or bitterness, with immense love and respect, makes his father see the validity of his argument, the letter wins. The father tells the mother to return the laptop and buy a professional camera  for his son. 
Another such scene where two rival philosophies clash appears earlier in the ﬁ  lm — 
the scene of the vital bet between Chatur and Rancho. It is a clash not of individuals but of priorities and values: Chatur’s obsession with success versus Rancho’s respect for excellence. The rivals decide on a date ten years later, when they will meet and compare notes on who won and who lost. While there is no overt use of objects in the scene, we achieved the ‘concretisation’ or the ‘solidiﬁ  cation’ effect through getting 
Chatur to carve out a date  on the mossy wall of the terrace. By being engraved on 
the wall, the date became tangible, solid, permanent. It received an import that it lacked when it was merely uttered verbally in earlier drafts. Chatur carves the date not merely on the wall but also on the psyche of the audience. "
"355Perhaps the most telling example of this ‘solidiﬁ  cation’ or ‘concretisation’ of a scene 
is the interval point of the ﬁ  lm. Both Raju and I were extremely proud of our twist: 
after a long and eventful journey, the friends seem to reach Rancho, but when Farhan puts his hand on the man’s shoulder, the man who turns and looks at them is not their friend. It is a complete stranger. The friends are shocked. INTERMISSION.  When we 
narrated this scene to Vinod, he didn’t share our enthusiasm. He was uneasy and restless till he realised what he was missing in the scene. A tangible deepening of the mystery. Vinod felt that without solid  evidence of some kind, the audience 
might take the encounter with the wrong man as some minor misunderstanding, a communication gaffe that might soon be sorted out. So he added a few extra seconds to our scene: After meeting the stranger, Farhan sees on the wall, a group photo 
of the classmates, featuring all three friends but the place where Rancho sat in the real photo is now occupied by this total stranger. The wrong man. INTERMISSION . The 
inanimate photo provides the scene with the ﬁ  nal turn of the screw. The nebulous 
mystery suddenly becomes concrete. The plot thickens. 
Am I reading too much into this concept of ‘solidiﬁ  cation’ or ‘concretisation’ 
through objects? Am I zealously overanalysing a moot point? Are there no major scenes in 3 Idiots  that do not rely on objects? Wrong. In fact, the most  famous 
scene of the ﬁ  lm, Chatur’s speech that goes outrageously wrong [ chamatkar  versus 
balatkar,  dhan  versus sttun] relies entirely on wordplay. So does my favorite scene: 
Rancho’s deliberately obscure, whimsical, and wooly-headed deﬁ  nition of books 
[“Instruments that record, analyse, summarise, organise, debate and explain information; that are illustrated, non-illustrated, hard-bound, paperback, jacketed, non-jacketed; with foreword, introduction, table-of-contents, index; that are intended for the enlightenment, understanding, enrichment, enhancement and education of the human brain through the sensory route of vision. Sometimes touch.”] In both these scenes we relied exclusively 
on verbal dexterity. In one instance crude, in the other, sophisticated. Do these scenes, then, constitute the antithesis of my argument? Hardly. Because these scenes, if anything, serve to demonstrate the devastating effects of the lack of ‘concrete’ understanding and ‘solid’ conceptual clarity that plague our educational system. The wordplay scenes are meant, as Rancho would put it, to be a ‘ demo’  of what 
obfuscation, empty jargon, hyperbole, pomposity, rote learning bring upon us — nothing but ‘balaktkar pe balatkar’.
Objects were our closest allies for three years. Like a friend that you can conﬁ  dently 
call up in the middle of the night at the time of a crisis, we knocked on the door of objects every time we were in trouble. Every time, they responded generously. Most "
"356times, like good friends, they didn’t make a big show of the help they had extended 
and remained largely inconspicuous. Almost invisible. But every object I listed here is now a part of what Rogers and Hammerstein have famously described as “a few 
of my favorite things.”  Right from the ofﬁ cial stamp  that seals Farhan’s fate at the 
beginning of the ﬁ  lm, to the astronaut’s pen  that with one signature turns Chatur’s 
gloating victory into a humiliating defeat at the very end of the ﬁ  lm, 3 Idiots, could 
not have been written without dreaming up hundreds of such objects. The most menial of these objects, are for me, things of beauty. They took our hollow scenes and ﬁ  lled them with humor or drama; they took our most abstract concepts and 
made them accessible. 
In Shakepeare’s words, they gave “the airy nothing a local habitation and a name.”

CASTING  A SPELLCASTING  A SPELL

"From the suppressed frustration of the hospital sweeper in Munna Bhai M.B.B.S , 
the helplessness of the retired man who breaks into an impromptu  stripping act 
to get his pension, to the sparkling purity of Chhote  in 3 idiots , while it may be 
difﬁ cult for us to recall the names of the actors who played these roles, their faces 
will remain forever etched in our memories; the characters merging into these actors making the on-screen persona inseparable from the one in reality. 
Rajkumar Hirani believes that the face maketh the character. If anything comes as 
a close second to the script in his school of ﬁ  lmmaking, it is casting. Every face 
visible in a Rajkumar Hirani ﬁ  lm has been hand-picked by him. “Casting is half 
the job done as far as characters in the ﬁ  lm are concerned. Sometimes, we ﬁ  nd the 
right people and at times, the right people ﬁ  nd us,” says the man who drives his 
ADs (assistant directors) and casting team literally up the wall even for the right junior artists meant to provide the ‘background’ in a scene.  
It took Raju a year to freeze on the actor for Joy Lobo’s father in 3 Idiots , a character 
that appears for barely two minutes on screen. Over ﬁ  ve hundred screen tests later, 
he exclaimed with frustration, “Maybe honest faces are vanishing from this planet.” The brief was to ﬁ  nd a face that would be the epitome of selﬂ  ess love, kindness, 
and innocence. Every heart in the theatre would break when he mourned his son’s untimely death. Raju’s associate, Rajesh Mapuskar, came to the rescue and suggested child actor, Madhav Vaze, from the acclaimed Marathi ﬁ  lm Shyamchi Ayee (Shyam’s 
mother) made in 1953. He would be of the right age now to play the role. The hunt for the actor began and he was ﬁ  nally located in Pune. The only question 
was: had Madhav’s face retained the same stirring innocence it had ﬁ  fty-six years 
ago? One look at him and Raju knew he had found Mr. Lobo.
And sometimes, the right actor ﬁ  nds his/her way to the right role. Every project 
goes through various stages of casting. A single change in the script could have "
"360one consider someone else rather than the actor initially under consideration for a 
particular role. If one were to imagine anyone other than Aamir Khan as Rancho, Kareena Kapoor as Pia, or Sanjay Dutt as Munna Bhai, the entire perception and tone of these characters would change in our heads. 
The principal cast of  3 Idiots  came together with all the serendipitous twists and 
turns of a commercial potboiler.  
 RANCHO AAMIR KHAN
I never thought of casting Aamir in 3 Idiots.  In his case, it is the right man ﬁ  nding 
his way to the right role. Aamir, in real life, is Rancho.
— Rajkumar Hirani
We had actually not thought of Aamir for 3 Idiots.  I happened to call him for Rajesh 
Mapuskar’s ﬁ  lm Ferrari ki Sawari.  During that time, we were also in the process of 
casting for 3 Idiots.  Aamir asked me if there was anything that Raju was doing because 
he was keen to work with him. I immediately called him in for a narration of 3 Idiots. 
And just like that, we found Rancho.
— Vidhu Vinod Chopra
In the twenty-six years that Aamir Khan has spent in the ﬁ  lm industry, he and 
Vidhu Vinod Chopra have met and spoken about several projects. Vinod had offered 1942: A Love Story  to Aamir but that fell through. After that, Aamir became 
accustomed to Vinod calling him once every few years and invariably asking for his dates for projects that were to begin shooting a month later. Aamir would always hear the script but decline because he needed more time to prepare. Moreover, he reasoned that if Vinod called him barely a month before the principal photography for a project was to begin, then he was anyway not the man Vinod needed for the job. 
So when in late 2007, his phone rang with Vinod’s name ﬂ  ashing on the display 
screen, Aamir assumed that it was one of Vinod’s regular ‘once-in-four-years’ calls. Vinod had called to discuss a project still in the process of being written. The conversation went something like this …
Aamir: “Yaar tu mujhe yeh sab ﬁ  lmein offer karta rehta hai , why don’t you ever
  offer me a ﬁ  lm with Raju?” 
 (You keep offering me these ﬁ  lms but why don’t you ever offer me a ﬁ  lm  
 with Raju?)"
"361Vinod: “Bulaonga to karega tu?” 
 (If I call you, will you do it?)
Aamir: “Script achchi lagegi to zaroor karoonga.”  
 (If I like the script, I will deﬁ  nitely do it.)
Vinod: “To phir aaja kal aur sunn le.” 
 (Then come tomorrow and hear it.)
Unaware that Raju had a ready script or was even working on a project, Aamir was 
stunned by the turn of events. Vinod had managed to stump him yet again. 
But this time things did work out.
You had expressed a desire to work with Raju. Both of you had even met and 
discussed a project. Why did things not work out earlier?
I have very high regard for Raju’s work and for Raju as a person. The ﬁ  rst time 
we met was at the premiere of Munna Bhai M.B.B.S . I loved the ﬁ  lm and thought 
it was wonderful. A little over six months after that, Raju called me to discuss an idea he had for a ﬁ  lm. This was before Lage Raho.  I was travelling then, but we 
decided to meet the moment I was back in town. After I returned, Raju came to meet me and told me that things had changed. In fact, the morning of the day we met, he decided that the idea he was to share with me, would now be used to do the second innings of Munna Bhai . I was still curious to hear of the idea. When 
I heard it, I thought it was a fantastic idea and completely suited the Munna Bhai 
genre. And Sanjay would do a great job but at the same time I felt that I had missed out on an opportunity. 
What drew me to Raju was his unique style of ﬁ  lmmaking. I had observed in the 
two Munna Bhai  ﬁ lms that he views his characters with a lot of warmth. So even if 
it is a bad guy in his ﬁ  lm, his approach to the character is very warm. In his work, 
there is a certain joy and simplicity which is what appeals to me and to all of us. Also, Raju is a straightforward person who you take to instantly. He has a basic respect and regard for each and every person he deals with, no matter who they are. 
After the ﬁ  rst narration, what was your reaction to the script?
My ﬁ  rst reaction to the script was one of disappointment. It did not work for me 
and if Raju had still wanted to make it the way it was then, I would have had to "
"362opt out. I felt sad because I really wanted to work with him. The script had a lot 
of potential but it was not in place as yet. I expressed my reservations to Raju. He heard me out and said that he agreed with quite a few of my points. He told me to give him some time and then he came back after about two months. When I heard the script the second time round, I liked it. A lot of the issues I had raised and he had agreed with, had been addressed. 
What were the problems that you had with the ﬁ  rst version of the script that 
was narrated to you?
My basic problem was that Rancho was too heroic in the ﬁ  rst draft. He was cocky 
and belting out one smart line after another. I felt he should behave like a normal guy. For example, in the introduction scene, initially, he was heroic in the way he faced the guys who were ragging him. It was Rancho’s attitude and not the scene that was a problem for me. The scene has stayed pretty much the same as it had been earlier. Rancho’s attitude did not make sense to me. A young boy who comes into the ﬁ  rst year should be scared when he faces his seniors. He cannot be this 
guy who comes in and churns out smart lines. He came across as too conﬁ  dent 
and too sure of himself. But as I understood him, he seemed to me a guy who is normal. He does not really know how to face guys who are stronger than him and are bullying him. That is the reason he runs away and hides in his room. 
The tone initially was of one-upmanship and I felt that Rancho should not really 
care about that. I wanted him to be scared in the ragging scene and do things out of fear and not out of knowing how to handle these tough situations. Similarly, in the scene where the Director addresses the ﬁ  rst year students and talks to them 
about the astronaut’s pen, had I said my lines in a cocky manner, then the character would have comes across differently but when the lines are said with a sense of excitement as though the idea has just occurred to the character, and he thinks it is a damn good one, so he just says it out loud because he wants to share it, that takes on a different colour altogether. Rancho is enthusiastic about his thoughts and shares them spontaneously but he does not know why the others are laughing because he has not said anything meaning to be funny. Yet, it comes across as a joke. Other people ﬁ  nd it funny. This is broadly what I had a problem with. It 
was the crystallisation of the core thought that I was excited about: what the ﬁ  lm 
is trying to say — chase excellence and not success — and this is what I wanted coming through in Rancho."
"363You were not convinced about playing a 20-year-old student in the ﬁ  lm. What 
made you change your mind?
When I read the script, I did not feel that Rancho is me because Rancho is a 
naturally brilliant guy and I don’t see myself as that. Rancho’s philosophy in life all along I have been following but as a personality he is a little quirky. I don’t see myself as that. But broadly speaking, how he lives his life is similar to how I live mine but when I was reading the script, I didn’t see it that way. Perhaps I don’t see myself that way, so I couldn’t relate myself to him. However, the interesting thing that happened was that I told Raju what I felt: “Though I love the script, how am I going to ﬁ  t this role? I am 43 now and by the time we make the ﬁ  lm, I will be 
44 and I have to play a 20-year-old so I don’t think I am the right guy for this ﬁ lm. I personally feel you should cast someone in that age group.” I even offered 
to help him ﬁ  nd a younger actor for the role. My fear was that fundamentally 
if people didn’t accept me as a 20-year-old, then the whole ﬁ  lm would go for a 
toss. And that would not be worth it. You are making an entire ﬁ  lm. There is too 
much hard work involved so why should you let the fate of the ﬁ  lm hinge on a 
weak point. Your lead actor is 44 and he is going to play a 20-year-old. Despite not being convinced of it ourselves, if we still went ahead and shot the ﬁ  lm, and 
it looked bad, then what were we going to do? This is when Raju spoke to me at length. I think during our interaction leading up to this conversation, Raju had become increasingly convinced about me playing Rancho. Maybe to start with, he was not totally convinced. I don’t know what was going through his mind but I felt that somewhere along the way, he became surer about me doing the ﬁ  lm. Perhaps 
the interaction helped him in his head as well. The ﬁ  rst thing he said was that he 
thought I looked young. Second, he felt that I could pull it off as I have often pulled off things that people have not expected me to. He gave me the example of Ghajini . His logic was that if I could pull that off, why not this? I kept countering 
him by saying that there were limits to what one can do physically. Lastly, he said, 
“Throughout your career, you have been like Rancho. You have taken paths that are unconventional. You have not followed any rules. Instead you have broken them. You have chased excellence and success has come after that. When you play Rancho, the audience is going to believe you as opposed to some other actor who has been chasing success in reality but spouts these lines on screen. You will bring a lot of credibility to the character and that is why I want you to play it.” This is what his opinion was but I kept insisting on ﬁ  nding a younger actor. This discussion went 
on. What eventually helped me make up my mind was Raju’s faith in me. We spent "
"364a lot of time together and discussed many drafts of the script and throughout the 
process Raju was certain that he wanted me for the role. I instinctively trust Raju as a director. I trust his judgement and instinct. I might not be able to see myself in a particular way but if the director is able to see me that way, and feel enthused and excited about it, then that is important to me. 
I am so glad he pushed me. I decided to go with Raju’s judgment. His faith in me, 
my intense desire to work with him and, of course, what he was making convinced me to take on the challenge. 
Once you were convinced and you signed the ﬁ  lm, what was your approach 
to Rancho? 
I felt Rancho is boyish and transparent. He has a clean heart so most of what he 
thinks and feels is quite evident to people. Had I actually been 20 years old, I might have played the character differently. I don’t know how I would have played it but it would have been different. At this age, I had the additional burden of pulling off playing a guy half my age. I had to approach him differently. I had to work on my mannerisms and the way I look to cut the age. I was really bulked up for Ghajini  
so I lost a lot of muscle. I tried to look as small as possible in order to look boyish. I wore oversized clothes. I had to internalise the mannerisms because if you don’t internalise them, they come out totally fake. In my head, when I was constructing him, I felt he is a guy who is constantly moving. His mind is buzzing. So he seldom stays still. He is either scratching his head, shifting from one foot to the other or shaking his head. He is quick. There is so much going on in his head that he has a lot of buzz in him. That is how I saw him. And because he is transparent, all that is going on inside him comes out spontaneously. This trait helped me negotiate the smart lines because the lines are very smart. I felt that if he is so smart, conﬁ  dent, and 
cocky, then he will become a pain in the neck after a point. To make him likeable, the audience has to feel he is innocent. Let me give you a ‘demo’ (smiles). One of my toughest scenes in the ﬁ  lm was when Rancho confronts the Director after Joy’s 
death. Those are some pretty heavy lines. You might feel those things but to actually go and tell the head of your educational institute all that and to actually provoke him without being asked anything is a rather extreme thing to do. The insinuation of Rancho’s words is severe. How does one pull this off? Raju and I even considered at one point to have Rancho drunk in this scene but then we did not go down that route. The best way then to go about it, and which is what I did, would be to play him as emotionally overwrought. He is so grief-stricken that he goes and says what "
"365he feels without thinking of the consequences. And the only way to balance the 
outspokenness of the earlier scene would be to show a degree of fear when he is in the Director’s ofﬁ  ce the next morning. He is not taking on the Director or playing 
this like a challenge. He is making a plea. I am saying a lot of harsh things to the Director and, therefore, I cannot come from a position of arrogance. 
Basically, I played Rancho with a different attitude. He is just being plain honest 
because he is innocent enough to be honest. He might be scared but he has to say what he feels because that is who he is. The smart lines, I know, needed to be retained but as an actor, I had to say them in a way that made them palatable. 
Farhan and Raju, as characters, were most likely to have the audience behind 
them because most people would identify either with Farhan or with Raju. Rancho is a man you admire but not someone who evokes sympathy or empathy. Was this a concern for you? 
I was aware of this but it was not a concern for me. One of the problems with 
Rancho, speaking from a purely dramatic point of view, is that he has no ﬂ  aws. 
When the character does not have ﬂ  aws, you may admire the character but you don’t 
emotionally connect with the character because he does not have any problems. He does not need your help. And he is succeeding in whatever he does, therefore, there is no sympathy or empathy for him. As an audience you don’t emotionally invest in him. For example, in T aare Zameen Par,  your heart goes out to Ishaan because 
you see the trouble he is going through. You are totally behind him as a viewer. It is a very author-backed character. The characters in 3 Idiots  with the potential of 
a strong emotional connect with the audience are Farhan and Raju. These are the two who have problems. There is a growth in these characters that results in their transformation through the ﬁ  lm. In Rancho, there is no growth. He is the same 
from the beginning to the end. It was a very big challenge for me to play Rancho because emotionally he is not author-backed. His only problem is that he loves Pia but cannot marry her. But that is not the main plot. This was another reason it was essential to not make him oversmart. He would have got on everyone’s nerves. I warned Raju about this in the beginning that we would have to be careful with this guy or he would be in danger of going overboard. I told him that he would have to be careful as a director and watch out and not let me slip up anywhere. 
And I think somewhere what works for Rancho is the screenplay because the 
screenplay really supports him. The story is about two friends who are looking for "
"366their friend. It is through their intensity, their warmth, and their love for this guy 
that the audience emotionally connects with Rancho. Whenever I read the script, I always cried in Farhan’s scene with his father and Raju’s job interview scene but I never cried for Rancho. I never felt bad for him. It was a task to engage with him emotionally. That came from the bonding and love that Sharman and Maddy brought for Rancho in their performances. The warmth they feel towards Rancho seeps through to the audience. Again, at another level, the screenplay is very clever because throughout the ﬁ  lm, you are looking for Rancho and you have only seen 
ﬂ ashes of him through Farhan’s eyes. We have not met him as yet. You meet him 
head-on only at the end where he is himself and not a person who is being looked at from someone else’s point of view. 
The tenderness, love, and warmth the three friends share warms the viewer to 
Rancho. The emotional high point for Rancho’s character is when he sits around waiting nervously for his friends to return from the situations (Farhan confronts his father and Raju goes for a job interview) they have gone to face, and the moment he realises that they have returned triumphant from these situations, he breaks down. 
You were not convinced about Joy’s suicide being in the ﬁ  lm for a long time. 
You opposed it vehemently. Why was that?
At the script level, I felt that it might not be necessary. The point was coming 
through in any case. It is accomplished through Virus’s character as his son had committed suicide. But the actual reason is a connected thing. If the suicide was retained, then the two scenes that came right after it would be very tough to negotiate for me. I was not convinced that people would buy those scenes because, like we just discussed, Rancho is saying some very provocative and harsh things to the Director. See, either the tone of the ﬁ  lm is at such a high pitch that saying all 
this to the Director is alright because the entire ﬁ  lm is like that, but we were not 
doing that. So this worried me. The graveyard scene and the scene after that were tough. Right after those is the classroom scene where he is challenging the authority of the Director and getting away with it. That line was a very tricky one: “Nahin 
Sir, mein aap ko engineering nahin sikha raha, mein to aapko yeh sikha raha tha ke padhate kaise hain.” (I am not teaching you engineering Sir, I am teaching you how 
to teach). I thought the audience would beat us for this. I had to really struggle to carry this off. I thought it would be best for Rancho to say this cheekily, pick 
up his bag, and bolt out of there. If I had said these lines in a heroic way or in "
"367a manner which suggested that I was taking on the Director, then we would have 
been doomed. 
But coming back to Joy’s suicide, in hindsight, when I see the ﬁ  lm, I think Raju 
was right about keeping the suicide just like he was right about all the decisions that he took. 
The principal photography of the ﬁ  lm began in August 2008. The scene in 
Ladakh, the climax of the ﬁ  lm, if not shot in the ﬁ  rst schedule would have had 
to be shot after a year as Ladakh is only accessible for a few months a year. The decision was made to shoot the climax in Ladakh in the ﬁ  rst schedule 
itself. Do you think it would have affected performances had you people shot it at the beginning and not a year later which is what you had to do because of terrible weather?
I was very relieved that we could not shoot the entire climax then even though 
it was a terrible experience for the entire team. We shot for a day and then bad weather hits. It was scary how we evacuated everyone to safety. But all is well that ends well. Our performances would have suffered because we had not lived those characters as yet. Especially mine. At least Sharman and Madhavan had shot in Bengaluru for the ﬁ  rst few scenes of the ﬁ  lm and, therefore, had forged some sort of 
a connect but my ﬁ  rst day of shooting for 3 Idiots  was in Ladakh. I told everyone 
that I was very happy because it would certainly have compromised the credibility we were able to bring in when we shot for it after shooting for the entire ﬁ  lm.
You actually drank for your drunken scenes. Method acting?
I actually ﬁ  nd it difﬁ  cult to do drunken scenes without drinking. It helps my 
performance if I actually drink and perform. I believe in aides. My goal is to give my best performance and if anything helps in achieving this, I am happy to use it. I am not one of those people who shy away from using things that can enhance their performance and eventually the ﬁ  lm. 
What do you think is the core of 3 Idiots?
Chase excellence and not success is deﬁ  nitely the core thought. To put it differently, 
do what you believe in and what makes you happy. What makes you happy may not always be conducive to what we commonly understand as success. Farhan wants to be a wildlife photographer and it may not appear to people that he may "
"368be successful doing that even in the conventional way. For this, ﬁ  rst one needs 
to understand what success is. Doing what makes you happy and doing it well is success. It may get you less monetary beneﬁ  ts. However, it may also get you good 
monetary beneﬁ  ts and one must not discount that. So you may get success in the 
conventional way as well by doing what makes you happy but the key is to do what makes you happy, what is fulﬁ  lling to you. That is the core thought of the ﬁ  lm. 
 PIA SAHASTRABUDDHE : KAREENA KAPOOR
The ﬁ  rst thing I did was to ask Kareena to put on weight. Even when she was shooting 
for other ﬁ  lms, I would send her messages saying, “Hope you are eating Kareena.” Pia 
had to be real and feisty.
— Rajkumar Hirani
I saw her in Omkara and Jab We Met . In my opinion, of all the actresses we have, she 
is one of the ﬁ  nest. It was a natural choice to go for a ﬁ  ne actress.
— Vidhu Vinod Chopra 
On a crisp November morning in 2003, Kareena Kapoor wangled a day off from her 
hectic schedule and headed for Gaiety Galaxy, one of the oldest single-screen cinema halls in suburban Mumbai, to catch the ﬁ  rst show of the latest release that week. 
She walked out of the hall mesmerised. A quick call was made to her manager, Zahid, 
from the parking lot of the hall enquiring about the man who had directed the ﬁ  lm 
she had just seen. Zahid gushed: “He is God! He is God! Don’t know his name but he has directed over 200 advertisements.” He promised to get back with details. 
The ﬁ  lm Kareena had seen was Munna Bhai M.B.B.S.  and its ﬁ  rst-time director was 
Rajkumar Hirani. His name was immediately scribbled in the wish list of directors in her diary. Kareena’s mother, Babita, told her to play her Sindhi card with him if need be: “Just tell him, ‘My mother is Sindhi just like you and, therefore, you must work with me.’ ” 
You had wanted to work with Rajkumar Hirani and Aamir Khan for a long 
time. 3 Idiots  presented the opportunity to work with both. How did this fall 
into place for you?
We met at Mukesh Ambani’s party in December 2007. Before I could go and talk to 
him, he came up to me and told me how much he liked my work in Jab We Met . "
"369Then he said the magic words: “I am doing a ﬁ  lm with Aamir and I might have a 
role for you.” I jumped and told him that I am game and he does not even have to narrate it to me. But Raju insisted that I hear it and then let him know how I feel. He was writing at the time and promised to call the moment he was done. When a month passed by without a word, I messaged him. This time, he asked me to wait for a week, and exactly a week later, Raju called and told me that he had ﬁ nished and I was called in for a narration. I went for the narration with absolute 
certainty that I would do this ﬁ  lm. Nothing was going to change my mind. I heard 
the script. My ﬁ  rst reaction was that this ﬁ  lm would create history and I wanted 
to be a part of it. I knew that the ﬁ  lm belonged to the ‘3 Idiots’ and my role in 
terms of screen-time would be small but this would be a ground-breaking ﬁ  lm 
and only a fool would pass up this opportunity. I have worked in this industry for nearly a decade and this was the most real and evocative screenplay that I had ever heard. Also, it was my chance to work with Raju Hirani. The simplicity and romance in his work are unmatched. He does not have to travel to Paris, New York, London, San Francisco, or build opulent sets or drape actors in designer wear to create magic. He plays with the magic of moments, of silence, and of life. He just moves you and stirs something deep within. I was in and nothing was going to change my mind.
With Raju, you got Aamir as a bonus. It took a decade for you and Aamir to 
come together. Surely there must have been opportunities before this?
There had been opportunities before this but nothing worked out. I was supposed 
to do Ghajini  but when Murgadoss approached me for Ghajini , I had already signed 
Mani Ratnam’s Lajjo  with Aamir. Aamir called me and said that he could not do 
two back-to-back ﬁ  lms with me. I opted out of Ghajini  and stayed with Lajjo . 
Unfortunately, Lajjo  was shelved. Vishal Bharadwaj was also supposed to do a project 
with us. Aamir and he had creative differences over the script so that got scrapped as well. Basically, every project we were supposed to do didn’t happen. I would often bump into Aamir and complain. He kept assuring me and promised that he would give me one of the best ﬁ  lms of his career. And today that has happened. It almost 
feels like a dream. I am in 3 Idiots  and it is Aamir Khan’s best ﬁ  lm ever. He is very 
lucky for the Kapoor sisters. Both, Karisma and I have given super blockbusters with him. I keep teasing Aamir: “You do one ﬁ  lm in three years so I don’t know when 
another heroine will get a chance to work with you. It will probably be my niece Samaira (laughs).” Aamir is truly a genius. He is a gift to work with."
"370Pia is very different from the roles you have done so far. What was your 
approach to Pia?
Pia is real. She is spontaneous and outspoken. I have received more accolades for Pia 
than I did for Geet from Jab We Met.  Geet was euphoric, mad, and larger than 
life. Every girl wanted to be like Geet but Pia’s USP is that she is every girl. She touches a cord across all age groups. I was shooting Kurbaan  around the same time 
as I was shooting for 3 Idiots.  Kurbaan  was such an intense role. 3 Idiots,  on the 
other hand, is very real and these are roles much tougher to play because then a heroine has to break away from her identity and image and reveal a part of herself. This is where Raju’s brilliance comes in. On the sets of the ﬁ  lm, I became Pia and 
that’s what everybody saw. Kareena vanished for the time that I was shooting for 3 Idiots . And Pia has made such an impact that it has left me speechless. I knew 
this would happen and that is why the length of my role was immaterial. No one ever thought of me as Kareena here. Though I was the only actor in the ﬁ  lm who 
was doing multiple projects at the time, I gave priority to 3 Idiots  as it was the 
ﬁ rst ﬁ lm I was doing with Raju, Vinod, and Aamir. 
At the time of the narration, I am sure, you must have looked forward to the 
confrontation between Pia and her father (Virus). That is the one scene that belonged to you. Was that a part of the extensive rehearsals that were held before the principal photography for the ﬁ  lm began?
This ia my favourite scene in the ﬁ  lm. When I heard this scene, I knew that this 
would be my big opportunity and the centrepiece of my performance. I was determined to nail it. I had come fully prepared for it. Raju was very keen that I rehearse this scene. I am a spontaneous actress and too much rehearsing does not help me. Raju listened to me which was very nice of him. I requested him to just roll the camera. I felt that the entire scene was set up in such a way that the only way to approach it was to be spontaneous. The scene begins with Pia clearing the table and you can feel by the way she is putting away the plates and the spoons that she is going to explode. This was done in a single take. I don’t know what got into me but I did not use glycerin. The moment I ﬁ  nished the shot, I expected to hear some kind of 
a sound but there was complete silence on the ﬂ  oor. I panicked and thought I had 
messed up the scene. Raju removed the headphones. He had tears in his eyes and the entire crew gave me a thunderous applause. I was preparing for this scene for a while and I knew if I did not get this right, then there would be trouble."
"371You did a drunken scene on screen for the ﬁ  rst time in your career in 3 Idiots ? 
What was that experience like?
Raju was really worried about this scene. I have never ever done a drunken scene 
and I am a teetotaler. This stretched on for ﬁ  fteen to twenty takes. Drunken 
scenes are not easy to do. It is very tough to get the consistency of drunkness and the slurs have to be the same. To make the job at hand tougher, this was a sync-sound ﬁ  lm. Aamir helped me a lot in that scene. He told me to look at the 
centre of my forehead so that my eyes look a little crossed. Raju even told me that I could drink if that helped me perform. These boys had done a drunken scene earlier and they had actually got drunk for it. Aamir kept on telling me to have a glass of wine. I told them that this route would not work for me because if I had any alcohol I would just fall asleep instantly. 
There were so many takes we did. Finally, Raju asked us to wrap up. I think he 
was fed up. He said he would manage something in the edit. I was feeling terrible thinking maybe I could not deliver as per expectations. But then the ﬁ  lm released 
and people went wild about the dhokla-fafada  scene. Fans messaged me dialogues 
from the scene and I went crazy with the kind of response I got. Raju was aghast because he had used a ‘No-Good’ take. Normally, actresses in Hindi ﬁ  lms don’t 
get the opportunity to do a drunken scene and when they do, it is a tough one to nail. I am happy that people gave me such an overwhelming response to my ﬁ  rst 
drunken scene.
Saif has worked with Vinod Chopra Films in Parineeta  and Eklavya.  He knows 
everyone well. Any advice he offered before you took on the ﬁ  lm? 
During the making of Eklavya , Raju had spoken to Saif about 3 Idiots  but at that 
time he was still writing. Shahrukh Khan stepped in later but then eventually Aamir did the ﬁ  lm. These changes are common in the industry as things keep 
changing according to how the script pans out. Maybe 3 Idiots  was not meant to 
be for Saif but he was so happy when he got to know that I was going to be in it. He was constantly on the sets with me and he saw the ﬁ  lm in the ofﬁ  ce before 
the ﬁ  rst print was out. He was completely ﬂ  oored by it. He kept saying, “What 
have they made? How are we ever going to surpass this? What have they done? Everything will now fall short of 3 Idiots .” Even though he had just given a huge 
hit — Love Aajkal  — the same year, he is one actor who was genuinely happy for 
our team. He is very close to Vinod, Raju, and Aamir, and was there throughout the making of the ﬁ  lm. He is as much a part of the 3 Idiots  team as I am. "
"372 VIRU SAHASTRABUDDHE : BOMAN IRANI
Boman has to be a part of all my ﬁ  lms. After school and college, it is difﬁ  cult to make 
lifelong friends. Boman is one such friend I have made. He was the only actor I wanted for this role and he did not have a choice but to agree to play Virus. He is a friend and I can completely take advantage of that friendship. 
— Rajkumar Hirani
Raju and your relationship organically developed into one that went beyond 
ﬁ lms. Your interaction on a ﬁ  lm is not restricted to just discussing the character 
you are playing. You are an integral part of his ideas team and long discussions revolving around the script between you and him are an essential part of Raju’s creative process. What was your reaction to the idea and the script of 3 Idiots 
the ﬁ  rst time you heard it?
Raju told me about buying the rights to Five Point Someone  when we were in Leeds 
for IIFA (2007). Raju was there to pick up the best director award for Lage Raho. 
I was very surprised that Raju had bought the rights for this book because my ﬁ  rst 
reaction to it was: “What are you going to do with the book? The novel in itself does not seem like material for a ﬁ  lm.” Raju told me that he and Abhijat were working 
on the screenplay. A few months later when Raju and I were on a ﬂ  ight to Nagpur, 
he narrated the script to me and I loved it. I had my concerns which we discussed 
over several subsequent sessions but what they had done with it was fantastic.
You were reluctant to play Virus because you thought it would be in broad 
strokes a repeat of Asthana from M.B.B.S.  Why were you apprehensive about 
Virus and what convinced you?
I was offered this role even by the guy who was planning to make Five Point Someone  
earlier but he could not get the project off the ground. The ﬁ  rst time I heard the 
character, I felt Irfan Khan would be very interesting in this role. For me, this seemed a lot like Asthana from M.B.B.S.  though Raju kept telling me that it is 
different. Eventually, I realised that I didn’t have a choice. I would have to do this. I couldn’t say no to Raju. Once that was settled, Raju and I got down to working on the character, ﬂ  eshing it out and giving it body. 
A lot of people felt that Virus was more a caricature than a character. What 
do you feel about that?"
"373Virus comes across as a caricature because, with all due respect, our teachers who 
have been teaching for many years do become somewhat caricatures of themselves. I fed on that. I played that up and that is why he seems caricature-ish. Raju and I travelled to Pune for a weekend. While writing 3 Idiots,  they had hired a 
farmhouse there which was used for writing sessions. For two days we sat and worked out Virus. 
I wanted this man to be special. I thought of him as dark and edgy with cussedness 
being the underlying trait more than anything else. The tone is of sarcasm. He has a mean streak. Then we started padding him up with quirks to embellish his character. The idea was also to take Virus away from Asthana as much as possible. We gave Virus this unruly dense crop of hair on his head. Instead of suits he wore these ill-ﬁ  tting clothes belonging to another generation. I borrowed a lot 
from people I know in real life. Interestingly, Virus’s daily ritual of the power nap whilst listening to opera and getting his shave done is drawn from Mahatma Gandhi’s life. He didn’t listen to opera but he was a very busy man. He had told his staff to cut his nails and shave him whilst he took a nap. This way he saved time. This was our reference point for the quirk we added to Virus’s character. Then I wanted him to lisp. For that I had to rehearse for months because if it did not look natural, it could go very wrong. Another of my favourites was that Virus has to be ambidextrous. I had called up Abhijat and Raju in America to discuss this with them. They loved it. Being ambidextrous is a mark of genius and my perception of Virus was that he is a genius. He is not an ordinary guy but he has chosen to devote his life to numbers instead of applying himself to greater pursuits. The only thing that we changed was his body language. Earlier, I thought that it might be interesting to have a man who constantly speaks about life being 
a race and his every habit is geared towards saving time, being laborious and slow in his own movements. He walks and moves slowly, but during the rehearsals this did not work at all so we changed it. All this really helped in uplifting Virus as a character.
This is your ﬁ  rst ﬁ  lm with Aamir Khan. He is the protaganist and you are the 
antagonist so to speak in 3 Idiots.  What was the experience like?
This script was narrated to everyone from Hrithik to Shahrukh. I have no idea 
why Aamir was not considered but eventually he is the one who did it and was a perfect ﬁ  t for the role. He is amazing to work with in all respects — calibre, "
"374commitment, courtesy. The experience of working with him is special. The deﬁ  ning 
thing about Aamir is that, the equation is not of two co-stars working together but of two colleagues, two collaborators. No one is working at cross purposes. All of us become a team and our goal — the ﬁ  lm. 
During the interviews, everyone told me that Raju pampers you more than 
anyone else on the sets? Is that true?
Who told you that? Tell me? (laughing) Were Sharman, Raju, and Aamir joking 
about this? I am sure they were. This is just what everyone says. He pampers everyone. No special favours extended to me.
 RAJU RASTOGI : SHARMAN JOSHI
Sharman was on my radar since the time my wife, Manjeet, and I had seen his work 
in Style. We had both really liked him and I wanted to work with him whenever the 
right role came along.
— Rajkumar Hirani
Sharman Joshi would have frequented the theatres more had he known that movie watching would reap such rich beneﬁ  ts. In early 2007, Sharman got out 
of Globus, a theatre in Bandra (Mumbai) and noticed Raju Hirani with his team in the compound of the cinema hall. Sharman had always wanted to work with Raju. Though tempted to walk up to him and introduce himself, Sharman hesitated thinking that this might not be the right place to approach him. But he was pleasantly surprised when on spotting him, Raju smiled and waved at him. Conﬁ  dence boosted, Sharman walked up to him. 
But bigger surprises were in store for Sharman that night. Raju told him that he 
had a role for him but since he was still in the process of writing, he would get in touch with him soon. 
Sharman went home in a daze. 
How did 3 Idiots  come together for you? I believe that the restrooms at various 
multiplexes have played an important role?
(Smiles) The ﬁ  rst time Raju Sir told me he had a role for me was at a chance 
meeting in the compound of a cinema hall. Though I did not get a call from him 
for a few months, after that I knew that the offer was for real. The very ﬁ  rst time "
"375you meet Raju Sir, you can feel the honesty and sincerity. He is not the ﬁ lmi lingo 
sweet-talking types. So I was assured in my mind that something would come out of our meeting. But as luck would have it, we bumped into each other once again at a multiplex (PVR in Juhu). We met in the restroom after the ﬁ  lm was over. We 
stood there chatting for 15 minutes. Again, a few months passed by. Uncannily, we bumped into each other in the restroom of the same multiplex yet again but this time during the interval. Raju and I joked that slowly we were inching towards the beginning of the ﬁ  lm. Three chance meetings at cinema halls are rather weird.  
Finally, we connected and I went and met him at his ofﬁ  ce. The ﬁ  rst meeting was 
supposed to be a casual one but I think Raju was so excited and happy that he narrated the entire script to me. This would be approximately six months after our ﬁ rst meeting in the compound of a cinema hall.
Shahrukh was doing the ﬁ  lm at the time when I was signed on. Then there was 
an eight-month break where Shahrukh was not doing the ﬁ  lm and eventually 
Aamir came in. Once Aamir came in, I was constantly in touch with Raju but during the in-between period, I did not bother him at all. That’s how this whole thing happened.
What was your ﬁ  rst reaction to the script?
I loved the script and even though they still had to make the ﬁ  nal decision about 
me, I went out that night and celebrated. I didn’t even know which character I would play — Farhan or Raju — if I was doing the ﬁ  lm. I honestly loved both 
characters so it would not have mattered to me which one I would play. Initially, 
Shahrukh was playing Rancho but later Aamir came in, and once he did, I auditioned for both the parts. I had read Five Point Someone  so for the ﬁ  rst script narration 
I had come with some pre-conceived notions about the different roles in the ﬁ  lm. 
For example, in the book, Alok’s character is rather weak. I was a little worried about that. But once the script was narrated to me, the character was completely different and was not weak. By the time Aamir was ﬁ  nalised, formal meetings 
happened, script narrations started, and then the auditions. I was comfortable playing either part because I felt both had a lot of scope for an actor in terms of meat and challenge. What is beautiful about working with Raju is that for every little change, Raju involves everyone. His humility is on a different level and he truly and honestly respects every individual. I was pleasantly surprised that Raju gave me a pen and pad and asked me to jot down what I felt about the ﬁ  lm and "
"376if I had any inputs, these could be discussed. He likes participation, and, most 
importantly, that participation is truly appreciated.
I auditioned for the role with the scene in the Director’s ofﬁ  ce after we were 
caught gate-crashing his daughter Mona’s wedding. It is the one with  “Sir aapki 
per plate cost kya thi” . At that time, Madhavan was not there so I had auditioned 
with another actor.
I was drawn to the script because it is about ﬁ  nding yourself. The scenes where 
Farhan confronts his father and his job interview are the core of the ﬁ  lm. I loved 
the human element in the ﬁ  lm and the journey of these two friends who ﬁ  nd 
themselves through various experiences.
You said that you auditioned for both Raju and Farhan? Did you seriously 
like both the roles equally?
Raju Sir being Raju Sir gave me the option of auditioning for whichever role 
I wanted to play. This he did in the ﬁ  rst meeting itself. Like I said, I had gone 
there with pre-conceived notions so I had my apprehensions. I told him what I felt about Alok’s character. He just smiled and narrated the script to me. After the narration, he asked me the same question. My answer this time round was whichever one he would like me to audition for. I had understood that both the characters were solid. He made me audition for Raju. Then, after a few weeks, he made me audition for Farhan. 
Eventually, he made me play Raju’s character. Frankly, this ﬁ  lm is so well etched out 
that I really didn’t have to do much. This script is remarkable and equally remarkable is the way it has been executed. For an actor, half the job was already done.
Before the ﬁ  rst schedule began, I read the script many times over. I knew the 
progression of the entire script from any given point in time. The script was the Bible, therefore, whichever scene we shot for, I played the script back in my head, followed the progression and performed it accordingly. My lifelines on the set were the script, Raju Sir, and my instincts.
For all the drunken scenes in the ﬁ  lm, I believe you people actually got drunk. 
What was that experience like? 
We had a blast shooting the water tank scene and the one after that at the Director’s 
house. It was so much fun. The night at the water tank went a little out of hand. "
"377We gave lengthy takes. The production team ﬁ  nally asked us to get on with it as 
they were running out of stock though I don’t think that was the case. I think they just wanted us to pack up (laughs). The night after that, we were at the Director’s house. Vinod Chopra was with us that night so he also drank with us in Aamir’s trailer. After a few drinks, he said: “Koi bhi bahar ka dekhega to kahega ke kaisa 
producer hai, khud bhi pee raha hai aur apne actors ko bhi pila raha hai. Shooting late ho gayi to kya hoga?” (If anyone from outside the unit were to see us like this, he 
would wonder what kind of a producer I am — not only am I drinking but I am also making my actors drink. What will happen if the shooting gets delayed?)
Not by design but by chance, Aamir, Madhavan, and you were ﬁ  nalised as 
the ‘3 Idiots’ and you had worked with each other before in Rang de Basanti.  
What was it like on the sets?
I was ecstatic when Aamir came in. We already had an equation. I knew how fabulous 
life was going to be on the sets and that made me very happy. Then I discovered Raju Sir on the sets and he was a pleasure as well. I was not sure how Raju Sir would be on the sets. I think he was a bit paranoid in the ﬁ  rst schedule. There 
was a lot of responsibility and pressure on him. He needed to be extra careful. I started to feel the pressure too. It was a Raju Hirani ﬁ  lm with Aamir Khan and, 
predictably, there were a lot of expectations. I could feel and realise how important it was for Raju Sir to set the right tone on the sets from the beginning. Once that was done, Raju Sir transformed and everything lightened up. There was a comfort factor with Aamir and Maddy. Also, Raju Sir really pampers his actors. I used to tease him about pampering Boman more and Boman would protest wildly. There is a complete sense of freedom with Raju Sir. You are allowed to perform a scene whichever way you want to and try options if you feel they might lend something to the scene. He is very caring towards every individual on the set and this is what transfers onto the screen.
 FARHAN QURESHI : MADHAVAN
Madhavan came in because we were looking for a competent actor to play Farhan. 
I had my doubts about Madhavan only because of his weight, which he promised me he would shed but I caught him eating kulﬁ  once. After the kulﬁ , the conﬁ  dence dipped 
even lower but then I was pleasantly surprised with his competence and he has done exceedingly well.
— Vidhu Vinod Chopra"
"378He watched Secret,  the screen adaptation of Rhonda Byrne’s eponymous bestselling 
book. Amongst other things, Secret  talks about quantifying desires by putting them 
down on paper. He did just that and wrote down the names of all the directors he wanted to work with. Raju Hirani’s name topped the list. 
Three weeks later he received a message from Raju Hirani.The next day, Madhavan boarded a ﬂ  ight to Mumbai.
You were approached for Munna Bhai  at the time Raju was thinking of making 
it as a television series. What was the meeting like?
I don’t remember meeting Raju for the television series. I was approached and we 
had met but I have no recollection of the meeting. It was only when Munna Bhai 
M.B.B.S. released that I came to know that it was this particular ﬁ  lm that Raju 
had wanted to make for television for which he had approached me. 
I remember seeing Munna Bhai M.B.B.S.  and saying where had this guy been 
hiding all this while. It is a sign of greatness to be able to say so many things in the simplest manner. He struck me as a ﬁ  lmmaker and not merely as a director. 
I desperately wanted to get in touch with him. I remember gushing and raving in the message I sent him after watching the ﬁ  lm. He immediately called me back 
and told me that he likes my work immensely. 
We met sporadically after that at award functions and social gatherings. I had even 
approached Raju to write the screenplay of Ramji Londonwale  because I thought it 
was a subject that might appeal to him. He was busy with Lage Raho  at the time 
but he was kind enough to suggest Abbas Tyrewala for it. Abbas was also caught up with his own ﬁ  lm. Eventually, Sanjay Dayma wrote the ﬁ  lm. But I knew the 
moment I met Raju that our connection was for keeps.
How did 3 Idiots  happen? Your belief is that the process started with you 
watching the ﬁ  lm Secret.  What happened when you got the phone call?
Sarita, my wife, had been telling me to get in touch with Raju. She had heard that 
he was making a ﬁ  lm that revolved around three engineering students. I reasoned 
with her that ﬁ  lms don’t get made that way. If Raju had not already considered me 
for a role, it wouldn’t be right for me and I did not want to put him in a spot by calling him. When I got the message from him, Sarita and I sat staring at it in stunned silence. I don’t know how much this has to do with Secret  but this was such "
"379an amazing coincidence. The message was simple: “Maddy, I need to speak with you.” 
Even before calling him back, I told Sarita that I was doing a ﬁ  lm with Raju. 
Then I called up Raju and he politely asked me to meet him whenever I was in 
Mumbai next. I told him, “I am coming tomorrow.” I remember going to his ofﬁ  ce 
and meeting him. He narrated the script to me which made me laugh and cry at the same time. 
I immediately offered to give him a screen test. He was aghast but I insisted. I picked 
out two scenes from the script. One of them was eventually not in the ﬁ  lm. This 
is the scene where one of the puppies I have grown fond of in the hostel dies and I get drunk and react. The other scene was the scene with my father in the ﬁ  lm 
where I tell him that I don’t want to pursue engineering. Raju was not going to take a decision right then even though I could see that he was convinced. He said that he would let me know. I did not hear from him for two weeks. Then I received a mail from him saying that Vinod Chopra would call me. This was somewhere in April 2008 and we were supposed to shoot in August. After waiting for some more time, I called Raju and asked him if I could give my dates away as I had not heard from them and my other producers were waiting. Raju was shocked to hear this and said that I absolutely couldn’t give away my dates because we were shooting in July. Apparently there was some confusion and I had not been informed. Then Vinod called and things were ﬁ  nalised.
Did you audition for both the roles or was it always Farhan?
Farhan was the only role I related to when I heard the script. I think even Raju had 
only Farhan in mind as far as I was concerned. When Raju narrated the script to me, 
I knew that every student and every father in the country would relate to Farhan. If I was able to pull this role off, then that would be my biggest achievement.
What were your ﬁ  rst reactions to the script?
The best part about Raju is that he encourages us to think like the characters we 
are to play. Our feedback is considered and taken very seriously. As an example, for a long time, I felt that I did not have enough of a trigger to go confront my father. Initially, the letter to Andre Istevan was not there in the script. I spoke to Raju several times about this. T wo or three weeks later, Raju told me about the idea of the letter to Andre Istevan that Farhan never posted, and that became the trigger. I did not even know that Raju had taken my apprehension seriously "
"380and had been working on it. Raju came up with this idea and then he and Abhijat 
planted the fact that I am an animal lover with a natural talent and interest in wildlife photography. 
The ﬁ  lm started its principal photography with your scene in the airplane. 
What was your approach to Farhan as he is also the narrator of the ﬁ  lm? 
The ﬁ  rst transformation you see on screen is in Farhan. So there was the additional 
challenge of making that believable. If the audience did not ﬁ  nd me convincing, 
then it would set the wrong tone for the ﬁ  lm. I set about working on my look ﬁ  rst. 
Also as a character, I go through maximum transformation. Raju’s transformation happens in college after his suicide attempt. He loses his fears and there is a complete change in his attitude evident in the interview scene but Farhan’s transformation in terms of his personality was to happen once he left college. There had to be a marked difference between the Farhan the audience would see in the ﬁ  rst scene 
and the one they would see in college. I gave myself a darker, leaner, and rugged look for the portions in the present. I am a wildlife photographer and, therefore, spend time in the sun, wear those jackets with many pockets to hold things that come in handy on a shoot and name an edgier personality. There is an aggressive dimension to Farhan, the wildlife photographer. But as an engineering student, he is mild and innocent. I went completely clean shaven, chubby cheeked with round boyish glasses. It took us a very long time to zero in on the glasses, I remember. So, I worked on the look as well as the personality to make sure that the journey of the character is evident and real. 
 CHATUR RAMALINGAM : OMI VAIDYA
We took a huge gamble by casting Omi. He has a long and important role in the ﬁ  lm 
and we were casting someone for it who did not know Hindi at all. It was a huge chance we took which paid off eventually. Omi is a great ﬁ  nd. He brought credibility 
and believability to Chatur’s character which was critical for it to work.
— Rajkumar Hirani
His feet were killing him. The entire day he had spent running from pillar to post taking care of proceedings at a grand Marathi event that he had organised in Los Angeles. A lot of people from the Marathi community in America had ﬂ  own in to 
attend the event. Finally, the night was winding down and it was time to let go and have some fun. He hit the dance ﬂ  oor and inadvertently started dancing with "
"381a girl. She was a screenwriter from Michigan and he, a working actor and ﬁ  lm 
director. They exchanged numbers. 
Four years later, the actor-director while on a visit to India to ﬁ  nd possible buyers 
for his ﬁ  lm, got a call from her — out of the blue. Supriya Kelkar, the screenwriter 
from Michigan was now working with Vinod Chopra on Broken Horses  and wanted 
to give Omi Vaidya a heads-up on a possible role in their production 3 Idiots. 
Omi Vaidya might never have bagged this career-altering role were it not for that 
random dance four years ago at a Marathi night in Los Angeles.
You have lived in America all your life and are a working actor in LA. Was 
Hindi Cinema on your agenda?
Both my parents were very supportive of my choice to pursue acting, otherwise 
it would have been very difﬁ  cult to do this. Most Indians settled abroad might 
not have managed to do what I did. I had my family backing me and that is the reason it was possible. My mother had wanted to become an actress but she could never pursue that desire so she made sure that at least I could follow my dreams. Therefore, I did not have to worry about things like rent and food after college and was able to concentrate only on acting. Bollywood, strangely, was never on the radar nor was the sensibility preferred or familiar. I did not know much about Bollywood ﬁ  lms. I had seen some of Aamir Khan’s ﬁ  lms. But three-hour-
long ﬁ  lms with all the dancing made little sense to me and the sensibility did not 
hold much appeal for me either. I had seen a bit of Munna Bhai M.B.B.S.  but 
nothing of Lage Raho . All of this, I later realised, was actually a boon. It was an 
asset to have little knowledge of Bollywood. It helped me when I was shooting with the top-of-the-line actors like Aamir Khan in 3 Idiots . I was not weighed 
down by the awe of shooting with the biggest star in Bollywood. I could perform without being hampered. 
How did 3 Idiots  happen and what drew you to the material despite no prior 
plans or inclination to be part of Hindi Cinema?
When I got a call from Supriya, I sent my showreel across and Raju liked it because 
he felt that I was very boyish and, most importantly, I was not from India. Initially, I was very sceptical. I informed them that I didn’t speak the language at all so how would this be feasible. The people scheduled to audition me just refused to listen assuming that I would at least have some knowledge of the language because "
"382everybody who says they don’t know the language, do know a little bit. Little did 
they know that I really did not know the language at all. 
I was auditioned on Raju Rastogi’s lines from the ﬁ  lm and I was terrible. I spent 
some three hours in the ofﬁ  ce reading the material. During the screen test, 30 seconds 
after I started saying the lines, the casting director started correcting me and a minute into the audition, she asked me to stop. I was politely thanked so I knew that they had not been impressed but then I had gone in knowing that I would fail. What worked in my favour was that Raju came into the ofﬁ  ce while I was 
meeting his team. He had some work there so I ran into him. We got to chat a bit and therefore a personal connection was established. 
A few days later, I received a call from the team asking me to come in again. And 
this time, they said that they would send me a script for the audition. They sent me a portion from Munna Bhai.  The brief was that I would have to learn the lines and 
not speak them. I was not to worry about speaking Hindi correctly: the character was an NRI though he had not been fully ﬂ  eshed out as yet but I was just to do 
what Omi would do. I felt much more comfortable with this. The way I did it was that even though I knew what I was saying, I did it like I did not because Omi would not know what he was saying. So I did gestures that were absolutely not in sync with what I was saying. They liked this a lot. After this test, the brief for the character expanded a little bit. I was told that the character is a top honcho of a corporate concern, always in a suit with a whole lot of expensive and fancy stuff. He has come back to India to prove a point to these guys who used to make fun of him. This was what I was given to play with. I was asked again not to worry 
about the Hindi. If I so wanted, then I could do it all in English. So I did this 
test even better. I smoked a ciggarette and did my thing. All the Hindi words that I knew were the bad words so I sprinkled what I was saying with that. My mother was there with me so she was a bit shocked. 
I did the audition well but I was quite sure that I was not right for the role because I 
did not speak the language at all. I went back to LA after this test and did not hear from the 3 Idiots  team for a month. In LA, if you don’t get a call for a week 
after an audition, it can be safely assumed that you didn’t get the job. 
But a month later, I got a call from the production team and this time I was told 
that I would be auditioning with scenes from 3 Idiots.  I knew then that I was in 
the race and, therefore, being seriously considered. Then I started studying the text. They gave me the now famous balatkar  speech scene. The other scene they gave "
"383me was the water tank scene where I lose my temper and the bet between Rancho 
and Chatur is made. I could see that they wanted to gauge whether I could do both comedy and drama. The Broken Horses  team was in New Mexico so I ﬂ  ew 
to New Mexico and did the audition. I gave it my best shot. I gave up a role to make it for this audition and I don’t regret my decision. Again, I did not get a call from the team for another month. Then Raju called me himself and told me that though I had done a great job someone had taught me how to speak those lines. He was right because my mom had taught me. He told me to stop learning Hindi as this character would know very little Hindi. They were writing him like that, therefore, if I wanted the role, I would have to stop learning Hindi and stop watching Hindi movies. He did not want my interpretation of the character and performance to be affected by such factors. 
Things work differently here than in the West. Did you have any apprehensions 
about being away from the Hollywood scene for the considerable duration 3 Idiots  demanded you to be away? 
I had my doubts because I was giving up six months of my life and not being paid 
much according to Hollywood standards. I worried about whether this was the right choice or not. But the very reason I chose this as my preferred ﬁ  eld of work was 
because I wanted to be able to do new, fun, and exciting things. This would offer all the things I looked for in a job. It was a new system and sensibility I would be operating in. Therefore, I wanted to do this and it was my choice. Also Raju’s sincerity and personal emails to me convinced me that I would be taken care of. 
Once I came down here and saw the level of professional courtesy I was extended, the sincerity and the seriousness, I knew I had taken the right decision.
What were your ﬁ  rst reactions to the script?
That it is a very long one (laughs). There were lots of pages. I read through it 
but I kept my focus on Chatur. I had not thought of the ﬁ  lm as a whole. I only 
focussed on my character. When I saw the full ﬁ  lm, that is when I realised what 
the whole ﬁ  lm was all about. I really just kept my mind on Chatur. Also my lack 
of knowledge of the language kept me from understanding a lot of things.
You were already dealing with language issues. I am sure there were portions 
in the ﬁ  lm that were more challenging than others. Tell us a little about those 
tough ones you had to get your head around?"
"384It has to be the scene on the water tank where I am angry and drunk. I am a 
happy person and emotions like anger and jealousy do not come easily to me. Before performing this scene, I had to separate myself from everyone to be able to do a good job. The anger and depression had to be worked on. I had a three-day break before we were to shoot this scene. I requested Raju to let me leave the production for those three days and to just put me up in a small room or club or hotel somewhere away from everyone. Raju agreed and I isolated myself. When I reached the set three days later, I kept to myself and let the isolation gnaw at me. Raju loved my work in that scene. It took me another three days after the scene to come out of the state I had driven myself into though.
What was the experience like for you since this is your ﬁ  rst brush with Hindi 
Cinema?
The whole experience was very different from America. It was very interesting. 
I really wanted to do this and I am glad I did. This was primarily because I knew that Raju wanted me and it is very rare and different from America where whether the director wants you or does not want you does not matter because the corporate guys make the decision. Here, the director really liked me and wanted me and we had developed a personal connection. Systems-wise, things were completely different from the West. Here make-up and costume trials were done in your hotel room which was a little odd. I got the script ﬁ  ve days before we began shooting. 
Though it took some getting used to, all of this had its own ﬂ  avour. Also, I am 
not from here so I don’t really have hang ups about chatting and mixing around with the drivers and kitchen staff. So I could absorb a lot and get in touch with 
the ground realities a lot better as I chatted with these people. These guys have the most interesting stories. The others are more politically correct and talk about show business all the time. The biggest perk of the role was that I was playing a fat balding guy in major chunks of the ﬁ  lm for which I had to put on weight. I put 
on twelve kilograms and had a lot of fun doing that because I could eat whatever I wanted and did not have to exercise.

"423Within a span of 10 months — between August 2009 and June 2010 — Om Books 
International has published the original screenplays of two unparalleled blockbusters of Hindi cinema — Lage Raho Munna Bhai  and now 3 Idiots  — directed by Rajkumar 
Hirani and produced by Vinod Chopra Films. This would not have been possible without the trust and faith Vidhu Vinod Chopra, Anupama Chopra, Rajkumar Hirani and Abhijat Joshi reposed in Om Books International. For this, not only am I grateful to all of them, I am humbled as well. 
Smriti Kiran conceptualised and compiled 3 Idiots: The Original Screenplay . I thank 
her for her efforts.  
I thank Shraboni Roy, our graphic designer, Sangita Koushik, our editor, Sanjay 
Gupta and Raj John, for their support.
And last, but not least, I would like to thank Dipa Chaudhuri for not losing sight 
of our common goal till the very end. Without her inputs and patience, this book would have fallen short of the expectations of those who wrote the original screenplay of 3 Idiots  and turned it into a landmark ﬁ  lm and a modern classic.

"425SMRITI  KIRAN  covered entertainment, particularly the Hindi ﬁ  lm industry for over 11 years as a journalist and 
television producer at NDTV, before joining the industry at Vinod Chopra Films where she worked on a ﬁ  lm 
under development, and brieﬂ  y on 3 Idiots.  
Her T witter proﬁ  le (smritikiran) describes her as a cinema junkie, freelance television producer and journalist, 
writer, aspiring ﬁ  lmmaker, voracious reader and coffee addict. Her husband agrees with the coffee addict part. 
In between reading primarily Indian authors and poring over Hindi ﬁ  lm scripts, she works on her own script 
which she hopes to direct into a ﬁ  lm one day. 
Apart from following her dreams and continuing to learn from the best in the business, she leads the screenplays 
division at Vinod Chopra Films, a venture which aims to bring screenplays of the greatest Indian classics and more recent ﬁ  lms which contribute to the dynamism of Indian cinema, to cinema buffs and readers across 
the world.
