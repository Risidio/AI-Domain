"NARROW LANES OF A SMALL TOWN - NIGHT
HER POV
As She glides through the empty lanes of the eerily silent 
town -- in the dead of the night, everyone asleep inside the 
four walls of their homes -- glancing left and right at the 
walls of the houses.
Each of the houses has a strange inscription written in red 
paste on the wall: O Stree, Kal Aana (Oh Lady, Come 
Tomorrow).
She pauses at the corner as She hears a rustle. 
Beat.
Suddenly -- a howling dog darts across the street and 
scurries into the bushes.
She glides along.
She passes a house that seems to have no inscription. She 
does a double-take -- as if to make sure She’s seeing it 
right. No inscription.
She lunges towards the gate.
BACKYARD - NIGHT
A SLEEPY GUY steps out to go to the loo located in the far 
corner of the yard.
As he sleepily wobbles across --
HER VOICE
(soft, hushed)
Prakash...
He stops dead in his tracks. WTF was that?!
Without daring to look back, he begins to walk briskly. 
Again --
HER VOICE
(soft, but firmer)
Prakaaasshh...
He slows down and stops. Scared but curious. Should he turn 
around and see?
A third time -- seductive, irresistible --
HER VOICE
Prakaaaassshhhh...
Beat."
"2.HER POV
Prakash slowly turns and looks at her (us).
At first he’s scared. Then the fear turns into curiosity, 
which then melts away, like he is seeing a beautiful woman. 
Beat.
Suddenly his expression turns into horror! And he lets out a 
bone-chilling cry, as She lunges at his horrified face!
CUT TO BLACK:
STREE
MORPH TO:
EXT. HOUSE IN A NARROW LANE - MORNING
The title morphs to the writing on a wall: O Stree, Kal Aana
SUPER: Based on a ridiculous phenomenon
The WATCHMAN -- an old man who has spent his life guarding 
the old town -- finishes writing the inscription on the 
compound wall with his worn-out brush.
Gets up -- drags his chair to the next house.
A line of houses behind him have freshly painted inscription.
OPENING TITLES APPEAR OVER --
THE SMALL TOWN AND ITS ENVIRONMENT - DAY
The town is getting decked up. Banners go up announcing 
various activities for the puja. People are getting ready for 
the annual weeklong festivities for the Gram Devta.
CREEK - MORNING
Scenic. Serene. 
A pair of Reebok sneakers pound the ground. 
In complete contrast with the surroundings, dressed in fancy 
shorts and sporty tee, headphones pumping music in his ears, 
VICKY is out on his morning jog.
-- He jogs past buffaloes.
-- jumps expertly over chickens running helter-skelter.2."
"3.-- dodges and avoids being splashed by a woman washing her 
front yard.
-- NCC Cadets are running/training in a ground, but nowhere 
close to his style.
-- He greets the bewildered townsfolk with ‘What up!’ or a 
'Later Alligator’ as they go about their daily grind.
All without breaking his style. In short — he’s too cool for 
this simple town!
OPENING TITLES COME TO AN END.
EXT. VICKY’S HOUSE
Vicky returns from his jog -- about to enter his gate, sees 
the Watchman approaching.
VICKY
Hello Chacha. You’re at it again? 
Going around town conning the 
idiots?
WATCHMAN
Vicky-babu, it’s not too late yet.. 
(points to the bucket of 
red ink)
This ink has been made from bat’s 
bones and an albino crow’s pee. 
This time I have also mixed in some 
ashes from devta’s temple. She will 
not dare enter any house with the 
message written with this special 
ink. 
(beat)
Listen to me.. Let me write on your 
wall.
VICKY
Don’t you dare touch my wall!
WATCHMAN
Yours is the only house with no 
inscription in this lane. You know 
what that means, right?
(beat)
When She enters this lane, she will 
have no choice but your house. 
Guaranteed entry!
VICKY
Tell your bullshit stories to these 
foolish people with small-town 
mentality. You wondered why this 
never happens in big cities? 
Because it’s just faltu 
superstition!3."
"4.WATCHMAN
So you are willing to risk your 
life for a mere hundred rupees?
VICKY
No. I am willing to stand by my 
belief and not let old men con me.
WATCHMAN
Your loss. Don’t come running to me 
when She takes you away!
Vicky scoffs.
NEIGHBOUR AUNTY calls out for the Watchman --
AUNTY
Chacha, don’t forget my wall..
(pointing to the fading 
inscription on her wall)
It’s fading. I’m not sure she will 
be able to read it.
WATCHMAN
Ji, madam.
Thw Watchman walks over. Aunty hands a cup of chai. 
AUNTY
I have made some chai for you.
WATCHMAN
Arre no madam. I have had a dozen 
teas since morning! 
AUNTY
Arre have one more. And make sure 
you have written it bold and clear. 
(adds)
I want to make sure she gets the 
message.
Vicky shakes his head at this charade and enters his house.
The wall of his house remains blank. An Eerie feel.
EXT. TAILORING SHOP - DAY
Board proclaims: MODREN LADIES TAILOR.
Styling independent women. Since independence (1947).
Women of various sizes and ages are milling about the shop. 
It’s rush hour at the shop. In contrast, the other shops 
around the area are dead.
Vicky cycles up to his shop. Sees the rush -- a few women 
light up at his sight -- he expertly turns the cycle, peddles 
around the block and gets to the back entrance. 4."
"5.INT. TAILORING SHOP
The shop is even more crowded with customers. There are 
tailors tucked away in corners and narrow nooks. 
As Vicky enters the chaotic shop, his DAD, spots him.
DAD
Why the hell are you so late!? It’s 
Puja season. Look! Look at the 
orders we have to finish!!
VICKY
Arre, most of them are all 
alterations. I told you we should 
exclusively deal only in new 
dresses..
DAD
Then for the rest of the year we 
will be swatting flies and all the 
business will go away to the other 
tailors!
VICKY
But Dad, this is chillar kaam..
DAD
This is not the time to discuss the 
manifesto of the shop. We have been 
doing this for decades and-
VICKY
Haan haan.. From independence to 
the end of time!
DAD
(shakes his head)
Why are you late? And why don’t you 
take this seriously??
VICKY
I went for jogging in the morning.
DAD
What! What the hell for??
VICKY
That’s what cool people do! Cardio 
is important to counter all the 
trans fat we eat all day--
DAD
Oh God! Can you please get to work, 
don’t get the ladies worked up. 
There’s nothing worse than a pissed- 
off woman.
(adds)
We should be grateful for the 
amount of business we get! I am 
thinking of even opening a branch..5."
"6.VICKY
You do what you want.. I am getting 
the hell out of this place very 
very soon. 
DAD
Why do you give emotional threats 
to me on every important day? You 
will kill me with this. 
VICKY
Nothing will happen to you. You 
will live 100 years doing blouse 
alternations. I.. I am meant for 
bigger things. 
DAD
Like what?
Vicky has no words. Dad stares him down for an answer.
VICKY
I will figure it out.
(beat)
Soon.
DAD
Till then, my dear son.. get on 
that bloody tailoring machine, and 
show them whose son you are!
SHOT OF --
-- Vicky slowly takes off his shirt and hangs it on the nail. 
Wearing just a vest, he takes his time as he puts a cushion 
on his seat -- squeezes some oil into the machine -- does a 
customary pai-lagu to the machine -- flexes his neck, rotates 
his shoulders, cracks his knuckles.
An OLD CASHIER and the Dad watch with bated breath. 
CONTINUING EARLIER CONVERSATION --
DAD
You have a gift my son! A rare 
gift! Not everybody is born with 
such talents! 
SHOT OF --
-- Then Vicky nods ever so subtly at the assistant.
Aaaaand the work starts. In full glory!
INTERCUTTING EARLIER AND NOW --6."
"7.DAD
I’ve stitched thousands of dresses 
but the way you handle that 
machine, those scissors, that 
needle.. aahahaha..
-- Vicky is stitching, checking, cutting cloth, marking and 
peddling that machine like a genius at work.
DAD
It’s purva janam ka phal.. That 
someone is born with a gift!
-- A bunch of ladies are standing in a line in front of 
Vicky’s station. Some are holding new cloth pieces and some, 
older clothes.
Vicky studies the first woman for just a second and --
VICKY
(rattles off)
38.. 3 inseam, 12 arms, 30 waist, 
40 hips.. 82 length..
(asks)
Medium or deep?
WOMAN 1
(awkwardly)
Err.. Medium is ok I think.. ummm..
VICKY
Deep. Deep will suit you.
The woman is happy. Next.
-- The next one dumps a bunch of blouses to the assistant.
VICKY
You can do these alterations after 
the Puja season no? Why does it 
have to be now??
(cuts her off before she 
answers)
Blouse loosen by.. 1.5.. 
WOMAN 2
No no.. 1 inch is ok..
VICKY
(doesn’t even react)
Actually 2 inch rakho. Also add 
extra hook in the back. Do double 
stitching this time. Ok next.
Woman smiles, embarrassed, but knows the genius is right. 
DAD
(overflowing with love)
Haraami.. Bastard.. Tu na.. genius 
hai re!
(adds)7."
"8.Never in my life have I ever seen 
anyone stitch a lehenga in 21 
minutes flat!
-- Vicky is moving at blazing speeds and finishing off a 
lehenga while everyone around is watching in amazement.
Snips the last thread and chucks the finished lehenga with 
elan. Takes a breather and shakes his head.
VICKY
Is this even a bloody talent that 
one should be proud of!
But dad has tears in his eyes. He smiles proudly at the Old 
Cashier, and turns to the altar and does pranaam to the Gods.
EXT. A PEACEFUL SPOT - DAY
Vicky is taking a breather. This is Vicky’s favorite spot -- 
where he steals a smoke during his break time.
Vicky puts his legs up, lost in thought -- daydreaming.
MOMENTS LATER
She glides towards Vicky. Unreal feeling!  
Just like a dream, a beautiful girl -- let’s call her GAYATRI 
since nobody really knows her name -- walks towards him. She 
looks enchanting.
Without realizing, Vicky gets to his feet, jaw slowly 
dropping.
GAYATRI
Hi! 
VICKY
Hi!
(a squeaky version of his 
voice comes out)
GAYATRI
Vicky, right?
VICKY
(nods. And keeps nodding)
Yeah..
GAYATRI
I saw you last year during the 
puja. 
VICKY
Yeah..
GAYATRI
I heard so much about you!8."
"9.He’s suddenly awkwardly aware that he’s still in a vest. 
GAYATRI
I am from the next town.. I come 
for the puja every year..
VICKY
Yeah?
GAYATRI
Can you please stitch a ghagra for 
me? (hands him the cloth)
VICKY
(automatically but still 
lost)
2 weeks.
GAYATRI
What! No.. 
(reaches out and touches 
his hand)
Vicky Please! I need it for the 
final night. For the Mangal Aarti! 
Beat. Waits for his answer. 
VICKY
10 days?
GAYATRI
Oh. (mood drops) Ok.. It’s ok then.
(adds)
Thanks..
And starts to walk away. 
Vicky snaps out of it and runs up to her --
VICKY
Hello hello..
(she turns)
Day after is ok?
She switches on a bewitching smile like she expected this.
GAYATRI
Thank you!
Vicky also smiles bashfully.
GAYATRI
Oh.. my measurements? You want to 
take my..
Vicky comes into his own. He interrupts her. 
Then as she just stands there, Vicky ‘scans’ her from top to 
botton. Gestures her to turn around. She tentatively turns 
around. He checks her behind.9."
"10.She turns back, unsure as to what happened.
VICKY
(taps his temple)
Le liya.
She chuckles. She’s impressed. He’s impressed at himself too 
for playing it cool. 
Then as she walks away, in an old-school fashion, Gayatri 
half turns to say--
GAYATRI
I am going to the temple for aarti 
tonight.
VICKY
Ok.
GAYATRI
For the aarti. 
VICKY
Ok. 
Gayatri smiles and walks away.
After a long hold, Vicky gets it! 
VICKY
Oh!
No sooner than she leaves, the assistant comes --
ASSISTANT
Vicky bhai..
Vicky looks at him, super irritated.
ASSISTANT
Daddy is saying 10 mins were over 
10 mins ago.
EXT. SARASWAT FAST FOOD CENTRE (SFC) - EVENING
It’s a local joint that serves fancy city items like burgers, 
pizzas etc. BITTU and JANA are one of the few customers 
lounging outside in the metal chairs. Bittu spots a group of 
girls approaching down the road. 
BITTU
Oh they are coming..
-- and puts on his shades -- and poses coolly.
JANA
Seriously?10."
"11.BITTU
That girl in the white dress always 
looks at me when I drive down on my 
bike.
JANA
That’s because you stare at her 
like a bloody stalker.
Just then Vicky comes plops noisily next to them.
He’s suppressing a grin. Both of them look at him 
suspiciously. 
BITTU
What the hell happened to you?
Vicky smiles and nods like -- ‘kuch hua hai.’
JANA
(mocks)
You finished all Puja orders?
VICKY
Screw you. 
BITTU
Say what happened??
VICKY
Love at first sight!
BITTU
Matlab?
VICKY
That girl from last year puja..
BITTU
Oh the one you made up!?
VICKY
(ignores the comment)
She came up and said ‘Hi!’ to me. 
JANA
Wow!
BITTU
And?
VICKY
And said ‘Vicky Please..’
JANA
Are you serious?
BITTU
Arre, phek raha hai yeh..11."
"12.VICKY
Sachchi! She even held my hand.
BITTU
Screw you! Abhi chada raha hai..
VICKY
Arre I am telling you. You can ask 
anyone at the shop. 
BITTU
She must have come to you to stitch 
some petticoat or something.
VICKY
Tsk! 
(beat)
I mean.. She came to get something 
stitched but--
BITTU
See, I told you. 
VICKY
But she held my hand and said 
‘Vicky please..’ (emotes 
exaggeratedly).
JANA
You kidding me!
BITTU
She said Vicky Please?
VICKY
No.. Vicky pleeease (with love)
BITTU
That’s what I said - Vicky please 
(dry, no love) 
VICKY
No.. Vicky Pleeeease (with love)
Bittu gives up. Then --
BITTU
Why did she even go to a tailor 
shop? When she can come to our 
readymade shop! We have latest 
designs and fashions. 
(shakes his head)
But the other two friends are not really listening to Bittu.
JANA
This is so cool man! Tu toh set hai 
matlab!
VICKY
(shy)
I think so.12."
"13.(then)
I think I will start loving her 
from today.
Breaking the moment, Bittu decides --
BITTU
So today you’re paying for the 
burgers and cokes.
Vicky shrugs. He’s just happy.
JANA
Ok guys, so what’s the plan for 
tonight?
BITTU
Yes. So. It’s going to be hectic 4 
nights of partying starting today. 
JANA
Yes!
BITTU
Tonight’s party is at the 
farmhouse.
(adds)
Jana, I am telling you again.. 
don’t breathe a word to that 
Narendra. That horny ass is always 
looking for a place to boink.
The others agree.
BITTU
We will have biryani there only. 
Music and videos are set. After 
that..
All three shout in unison.
ALL THREE
Raat bhar. PARTY!!!!
A short funky SONG starts --
TOWN - LATE EVENING
-- The town is abuzz with excitement of the annual Puja. 
-- Pretty lights liven up some of the streets.
-- People start to pour out to the mela around the temple. 
STREETS - LATE EVENING
Vicky, Bittu and Jana are going triples on a bike. All 3 are 
dressed up for the night. Bittu is driving.13."
"14.They cruise around the town, checking out the sights - mainly 
girl groups and the special decorations at rich people’s 
houses.
EXT. JANA’S HOUSE - LATE EVENING
Jana’s mother catches them passing. She calls out --
MOTHER
Don’t stay out too long!
JANA
Arre ma, it’s Puja! We are going to 
be out all night!
MOTHER
Go to the temple and come back. 
Don’t do dirty things! It’s Puja 
time!
(adds)
And be careful that Stree is back 
it seems!
They just laugh and rush away from there.
JAYBHARAT THEATER - NIGHT
The poster outside is of a random English film - ‘Bedroom 
Eyes 4.’ Hand painted comment says ‘Puja Special XX.’ There’s 
a Houseful board outside the gate.
A huge crowd is making their way inside. Among them are our 
boys. Bittu gives tickets to the usher--
BITTU
(proudly)
Balcony!
(to his friends)
Told you I have connections at very 
high places!
VICKY
(jibes)
Yeah man! You are truly connected. 
To be able to get tickets for dirty 
pictures!
Bittu ignores the comment. They proceed towards their seats, 
wading through the crowd.
INSIDE
The movie starts abruptly, sending a ring of chaotic 
excitement through the hall. Everybody hurries to take their 
seats amidst whistles and cat calls. 14."
"15.OUTSIDE
The place is completely empty now. Everybody’s inside. Faint 
sounds of the movie wafts out.
Time flies and the ambience gets spooky.
INSIDE
The film playing is harshly interrupted -- and a different 
film starts rolling. The ‘bit’ everyone was waiting for. 
The hall erupts for a brief moment.
It’s a full-figured, out-of-shape Mallu ‘aunty’ getting ready 
to take a bath.
The hall quickly goes silent and gets immersed in the 
activity on the screen.
The aunty continues to bathe herself with generous amounts of 
water from the bucket, while still clothed of course. In a 
stunning surprise, another girl joins the bath. 
An audible gasp goes through the theatre. All the three 
friends are watching the ongoings with their mouths open in 
varying degrees.
The spell is finally broken when the ‘Interval’ card comes on 
the screen.
JANA
Highlight hai!
BITTU
That’s possibly the best bit ever!
VICKY
Truly an achievement in cinematic 
history!
CONCESSION STAND
The three boys are standing at the over-crowded concession 
stand. Everybody is clamouring for the stale food that’s 
being sold like hot cakes.
A mini riot is almost breaking out over who needs to be 
serviced first.
Suddenly Jana notices.
JANA
Vicky! Your dad!
VICKY
What!
(instinctively hides)
Where? Where?15."
"16.BITTU
There.. He was in the lower stall..
Sure enough Vicky’s Dad is emerging out of the Stalls area.
VICKY
Shit! Are you kidding me!
Vicky makes best efforts to hide and dodge as the Dad starts 
heading towards them. 
Vicky starts to wade his way through the crowd but it’s 
proving very difficult. 
It’s a tense moment as Vicky barely manages to escape his 
dad. He sneaks around to go behind his dad, out of his sight. 
He beckons his friends to get out of there too. But Bittu 
wants his food first. 
Thankfully food is thrust into their hands and they retreat 
from there. But not before Vicky’s dad sees them.
Long beat. 
Vicky’s dad’s face turns into disapproval and shakes his head 
at them - like ‘Shame on you’. 
JANA
(mutters)
Sorry Uncle. 
Vicky’s dad spits in disgust.
Thankfully Vicky has escaped the scene.
Almost.
Suddenly there’s loud shout across the lobby.
VOICE
Ey.. Vicky!!
WTF! Vicky turns to see. It’s that bloody NARENDRA!
At the same time everyone concerned turns to see too. 
Including his dad. 
Vicky is caught just a few feet away from his dad.
They both stare at each other. 
For a long time. 
Then slowly both of them walk away from each other. 
Vicky walks towards the balcony -- realizes that’s not where 
he should go and starts to walk out of the theatre.16."
"17.OUTSIDE
The three friends walk out.
BITTU
Let’s go back in. Your dad won’t 
know!
JANA
I didn’t know your dad is fan of 
these films!
BITTU
Let’s quietly go back in. He won’t 
be able to see us in the dark!
VICKY
Shut the hell up! Are you kidding 
me!? I am already screwed.
BITTU
Come on, I got these tickets with 
great difficulty.
VICKY
Listen. All the good bits are over. 
They rarely play any good ones in 
second half. 
JANA
True. He has a point. They don’t 
usually mess with the storyline in 
the second half. That’s when movies 
take off. 
VICKY
Plus it’s getting late for Aarti.
BITTU
What’s with you and aarti!!
VICKY
Chal na.. Chalo. Baat khatam. 
Narendra interrupts them --
NARENDRA
What’s up, guys? Not watching the 
second half?
VICKY
Hi Narendra.
BITTU
See, I told you!
NARENDRA
Supposed to be a group shower in 
the second half. 17."
"18.BITTU
I knew it!
VICKY
It’s alright.. We have other things 
to do..
NARENDRA
Party no?
JANA
(nods his head)
Yeah--VICKY
No no.. It’s not a party.. 
It’s just--
NARENDRA
I am coming.. I have some 
‘friendship’ to do.. (winks) You 
want to see the ‘girlfriend?’
-- and without waiting for their reaction, he pulls out his 
phone and shows a picture.
JANA
Super! 
NARENDRA
Hai na!
JANA
Mind-blowing!
Vicky and Bittu look at each other like WTF!
NARENDRA
So, where’s the party?
VICKY
It’s not really--JANA
At the MLA farmhouse..
NARENDRA
Super! I’ll see you there! Now I 
have to go watch second half. 
-- and leaves. 
Bittu slaps Jana on the head --
BITTU
Why don’t you put a red carpet out 
for him!
VICKY
Jana, you’re an idiot, man!
JANA
I had no choice! He already knows.18."
"19.TEMPLE - LATE EVENING
A long of line of devotees are in the queue to have darshan. 
All of them are craning their necks to get a teaser look at 
the God before they reach the deity. 
Except the three boys. They are checking out the girls coming 
back from darshan on the other side.
BITTU
I still don’t understand why we 
have to come to temple. We are 
going to be late to the party.
JANA
Well.. At least the girls are good 
today. Some paisa vasool, at least.
VICKY
Have some shame and stop thinking 
dirty things. Bhagwan ka smaran 
kar. 
(adds)
Look, God is watching.
MOMENTS LATER
They reach the deity. Each one suddenly becomes all religious 
and sincere as they pray.
VICKY (V.O.)
Hey Bhagwan, thank you so much for 
sending a girl to me.. erm.. for 
sending a gorgeous, beautiful, 
unbelievable, out-of-this-world, 
super-cool girl to me. Please help 
a little more and solidify this 
deal.  
BITTU (V.O.)
Hey Bhagwan please send a girl to 
me.. Umm.. a sexy, hot babe to me. 
Why should Vicky get a girl first? 
Readymade shop is better than 
Tailor shop no? 
(adds hastily)
By the way, my shop is: Sanandan 
Readymade Showroom. Gandhi Road. 
Opposite Agarwal Sweets. I am there 
between 1pm to 4pm. 
JANA (V.O.)
Hey Bhagwan, these two don’t have a 
clue how to treat a girl.. why do 
they get all the chances? Please 
send a nice homely, sweet, mere-
bachon-ki-ma kind of girl to me. 
You usually never give me a chance, 
but see, if you can give me--
Bittu yanks Jana out of there.19."
"20.BITTU
Chal chal, enough praying! Party 
time now. 
And Jana is pulled off before he can finish praying.
MOMENTS LATER
As the three walk out of the temple, Vicky is looking around 
for someone. 
JANA
What are you looking for?
VICKY
What? Nothing. 
BITTU
Chalo chalo.. Enough time wasted. 
Already ate into party time..
(turns to Vicky)
What?
VICKY
You guys go ahead, I will catch up.
VICKY
Nothing.. (looking around) I will 
just sit for a bit and peacefully 
meditate-- 
BITTU
What!??
VICKY
They will start giving Prasad soon. 
I will bring some for everyone.
BITTU
What? What for?!
BITTU
Who the hell wants to eat Prasad 
now.. We have chicken lollipops and 
kheema patties waiting there!
JANA
Kya hogaya tujhe aaj? Bhagwan ka 
bhoot chad gaya?
BITTU
Wait a minute! You fuckers are 
waiting for that girl to show up!!
JANA
Really? She’s coming to meet you 
here.20."
"21.VICKY
Arre nahi yaar.. I just want to get 
prasad-
BITTU
Prasad my foot. 
(shakes head in disgust)
Look what has become of you! 
Unbelievable! You are ditching your 
friends for a girl?? 
VICKY
Don’t get dramatic now. Shut up and 
go. Isko lekeja.. I will be there 
in 5 minutes. Go!
BITTU
(overacts)
For a girl!??
JANA
Ey.. Chal na overaction.
-- and drags Bittu out.
OUTSIDE TEMPLE - MOMENTS LATER
Bittu and Jana get on the bike. Bittu kickstarts it. Doesn’t 
start.
BITTU
What the...
(checks)
Oh, no petrol.
JANA
Why the hell do you not put more 
than two points at a time?! You’re 
always running out of petrol!
BITTU
Tell my baap that! He gives me just 
enough money for two points!
(gives up)
What now?
JANA
Useless bike.
(kicks it)
Let’s walk. We have to buy the 
alcohol first.
-- and they leave.
CONTINUOUS
As soon as they leave, Vicky steps out of the temple. And 
waits by the side.21."
"22.She glides towards Vicky. Unreal.
Then --
VOICE
Hi!
Vicky turns around and -- it’s the ethereal vision of 
Gayatri!
VICKY
(squeaky voice)
Hi!
GAYATRI
You came here a while back?
VICKY
(mumbles)
Yeah..
GAYATRI
You have some kind of a speech 
problem or something?
Vicky snaps out of it. 
VICKY
What!? No! I was just.. I was.. 
You.. I.. I am only.. Was..
GAYATRI
Oh.. So sorry! I didn’t know you 
had a problem..
VICKY
Nahi yaar.. Hi!Howareyou?All 
well?Haddinner?Iamgladyoucameto 
meetme.Youarelookingsofine. 
(beat)
Sorry..
GAYATRI
(smiles)
All well. How are you?
VICKY
All well all well.. 
Beat.
VICKY
Sorry, I haven’t started on your 
lehenga yet.
GAYATRI
That’s ok.. 
VICKY
Will start first thing tomorrow 
morning. 22."
"23.GAYATRI
Oh great.. Thank you.
VICKY
Welcome. 
Beat.
VICKY
You missed the aarti by the way.
GAYATRI
I know! I got stuck.. 
Vicky tries to get a bit shaana --
VICKY
Next time I can call you.. And tell 
you when to start..
GAYATRI
I don’t use mobile phone.
VICKY
Oh. Then.. How do I get in.. How 
does one get in touch with you?
GAYATRI
(smiles)
Just think of me. And I’ll be 
there.
Oh.
Vicky tries again -- 
VICKY
Tomorrow also I am coming for 
aarti.
GAYATRI
Ok. 
(gets it. Smiles)
Aah! 
Long beat. They don’t know what else to talk.
VICKY
You want some prasad? I think today 
is jalebi. 
GAYATRI
Sure.
VICKY
Yeah? Great, I will--
(checks)
Oh.. Prasad counter hasn’t opened 
yet. 23."
"24.GAYATRI
That’s ok.
VICKY
Sorry.
Awkward silence again.
PEHLI RAAT
EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
Eerie. Silent.
The camera hovers above the woods.
EXT. WOODED LANE IN THE OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT
Heavy woods line the narrow dirt path that leads to the 
farmhouse. Bittu and Jana walk, carrying clinking bottles of 
alcohol in some makeshift bags.
BITTU
That fucker is definitely hiding 
something.
JANA
Like what?!
BITTU
Girl stuff obviously! He stayed 
back to line-fy that girl.
(turns to Jana)
How many years have we known him? 
Has he ever wanted to go to the 
temple? Ever?
JANA
Hmmm. Have you seen the girl?
BITTU
(shakes his head)
No. Fucker doesn’t even show a 
picture. Maybe she’s ugly.
(convinces himself)
Yeah that’s it! I bet she’s ugly.
A rustle.
They both stop.
JANA
Did you hear that?
They realize they are all alone in the middle of nowhere.
Tension.24."
"25.They slowly walk along, looking over their shoulders -- is 
someone watching them?
Tension builds.
It crescendoes -- and is cut by the sound of --
A old scooter. Which pulls up next to them. It’s RUDRA -- a 
weird man in his late 30s -- with a strange drawl.
RUDRA
Eyy.. What are you two doing here 
all alone?!
BITTU
Kya hua?
RUDRA
Haven’t you heard?! She is out on 
the prowl. Making her rounds.
JANA
Who?
RUDRA
Who else?
(leans forward)
Stree.
JANA
(also leans forward)
The Stree?
BITTU
Arre Rudra-bhai. Stop scaring him 
unnecessarily--
RUDRA
I’m warning you, not scaring you! 
It is not safe for men to venture 
out alone at night! If you have 
some work, send a female in your 
family out. And when you do go out, 
cover your body well.
They both look at him, bewildered.
RUDRA
Because once she takes you, she 
only leaves your clothes behind!
JANA
What does she do with the men she 
takes?
RUDRA
Who knows! Has anyone come back to 
tell?
BITTU
Rudra-bhai, is she really for real? 
I’m not sure if the whole thing is--25."
"26.JANA
Bittu, then how do you explain all 
the men that have gone missing?
RUDRA
Exactly! How do you explain that?!
BITTU
I don’t know--
RUDRA
Listen, my friends, she is for 
real. And she is angry.
Jana is visibly scared. Darts looks on both sides anxiously. 
Bittu is getting uncomfortable. 
An creepy atmosphere builds up, as Rudra explains --
RUDRA
Never venture out alone. The safest 
place is inside your four walls, 
with the message written by your 
front door.
(beat)
If you have to be out, beware of 
crossroads. Those are her favourite 
haunts. Try to be as quiet as 
possible. Remove your slippers, the 
noise attracts her.
(beat)
When she sees you, she will first 
call you by your name. Very 
sweetly... 
(chilling pause)
DO NOT look back. If you do, she 
will think you’ve given her consent 
and..
(Jana and Bittu shudder)
She’ll call your name again. Even 
sweeter. Closer. But my friends, 
just keep walking. Don’t run, just 
walk.
(they’re getting spooked)
She’ll call your name a third time. 
It will be irresistible.
BITTU
(anxiously adds)
But we never turn back.
RUDRA
Aaj tak aisa mard paida nahi hua, 
who can resist her voice. Everybody 
turns back.
BITTU
Oh! Shit.
JANA
Then?! How do we escape?26."
"27.RUDRA
There is only way to avoid being 
taken. Remember this - this is most 
important - whatever happens--
-- his phone rings, shattering the quiet! He answers, as 
Bittu and Jana look about, scared --
RUDRA
Haan ji. -- Haan. -- Ok. -- Haan 
abhi ho jaayega. -- Pahunch hi raha 
hoon. 
-- and as abruptly as he came, he zooms off on the scooter.
BITTU
He didn’t finish the sentence.
JANA
What?
BITTU
He said: remember this - this is 
most important - whatever happens. 
And he left. 
JANA
Oh! Shit. We need to find out.
They look around. They are alone in the middle of the woods. 
An eerie silence.
BITTU
We should go.
And they start walking. 
The bottles start clinking again. Jana holds the bag tight to 
stop the noise. They walk quietly.
Neither looking at the other, both acting normal, but 
shitting bricks inside. 
Eerieness builds up.
In the far distance, they can see the light of the farmhouse.
Long beat, as they silently walk, trying not to act scared.
CRACK! A twig snaps somewhere!
Bittu and Jana both scream and run the Lady out of there.
FARMHOUSE - NIGHT
An old ill-maintained bungalow primarily used by the local 
MLA for weekend retreats and bringing prostitutes over.27."
"28.His nephew Lokesh now has the keys, and this is where the 
party is! There are about a dozen hyper young guys, with 
Lokesh playing host --
LOKESH
Ok guys, first we play antakshari.. 
Then I have organized a music quiz--
VICKY
Aur uske baad rangoli competition.. 
(everybody laughs)
Chup baith aur daaru pee. Gaana 
bajaate hai!
GUY
Phir late night Sunny ka videos 
dekhte hai..
A cheer goes up. 
MUSIC starts --
Lokesh tries to maintain some order --
LOKESH
Guys, don’t make a big mess. My 
uncle has a party meeting tomorrow. 
He’ll be pissed if the place is not 
clean..
-- but nobody is listening. The guys are crowding the 
portable cooler to pick up beers.
Bittu and Jana enter -- Vicky greets them at the door.
VICKY
What happened? Why did you guys 
take so long?
BITTU
Nothing.
JANA
Yeah we were walking slowly.
BITTU
We were just enjoying nature.
Vicky looks at them --
VICKY
Why are you both sweaty? Did you 
run here?
BITTU
No.JANA
No.
Vicky looks at them suspiciously. They’re interrupted by a 
commotion -- Narendra has arrived.28."
"29.NARENDRA
I’m ready to party, bitches!! Who’s 
ready to party? 
-- MUSIC picks up --
Vicky, Bittu and Jana join the commotion.
A FUN PARTY SONG. 
-- Lots of daaru flowing. 
-- One guy puts on a sari and pretends to be a girl, others 
dance around him.
-- Bittu is hogging the snack counter. 
-- Jana is ribbing with a bunch of friends. 
-- Narendra is going berserk with his crazy dance moves.
-- Lokesh is trying to maintain some semblance of order.
-- Vicky is enjoying himself -- drinking and dancing
As the SONG begins to end -- 
Vicky needs to pee. The line to the bathroom is rather long. 
Instead of waiting, he decides to --
EXT. FARMHOUSE
Vicky positions himself outside the gate -- tipsy and bladder 
bursting -- starts to pee.
Relief.
He notices he’s peeing right next to the ominous message on 
the wall. Playfully he repositions himself and starts to pee 
on the message.
Done peeing, he looks at the message. With a satisfied 
chuckle he leaves.
The message on the wall reads: O Stree ... Aana
Hold.
Long hold.
A really long fucking hold.
BAM!! Suddenly a shadowy figure swishes past! 
A moment later -- a sari pallu -- attached to the shadow.
The sudden power cut results in a BLACKOUT! 29."
"30.INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT
Undeterred the party goes on. With boys swinging with their 
mobile phone flashlights in hand.
The doorbell rings.
A drunk GUY, closest to the door -- turns to look. Nobody 
else is paying attention.
He slowly teeters towards the door. Tension.
Peeks through the glass panel in the door.
In the darkness we see the outline of a woman standing 
outside.
More tension.
Too drunk to really think much, the guy opens the door. 
The lady is motionless.
The shadowy lady lifts her head and looks at him. He just 
stares back.
NARENDRA (O.S.)
Oh you’re here?
(tells a guy next to him)
She’s a ‘girlfriend.’ Called her 
for ‘friendship.’
Narendra comes to the door to get her in.
LADY
You didn’t tell me there will be so 
many guys.
It’s a woman, well into her 30s.
NARENDRA
(tells his friend)
You go in, I got this.
(to the lady)
I told you it’s a party. What 
difference does it make? I’ll find 
a room for us upstairs.
-- as they enter -- 
LADY
Well, I could have brought some of 
my friends for ‘friendship’ with 
your friends.
NARENDRA
Nah, they’re all useless. They just 
want to watch Sunny do it.30."
"31.HER POV
Narendra and Lady walk away, leaving the door ajar. 
Beat.
She glides towards the door -- enters --
INSIDE -- 
She stays in the shadows -- observing the boys being boys -- 
loud and rowdy.
She sees Narendra whisking his lady friend away and going 
upstairs.
UPSTAIRS BEDROOM
Narendra and Lady in bed.
LADY
What happened?
NARENDRA
I don’t know. Is it important?
-- leans in to kiss her -- she pushes him back --
LADY
This place is creepy. Go check what 
happened to the lights.
Narendra reluctantly gets up --
HER POV
She emerges from behind the pillar and looks at the posse of 
boys. Holding phone flashlights. Looks like a buffet laid out 
for her! Eeni meeni myni mo.. She looks at each of the boys.
JANA, looks directly at Her.
Beat.
He can see a shadowy figure in the darkness, but not entirely 
sure.
The moment he looks away, She moves behind a pillar.
Jana decides to investigate. He slowly walks towards the 
corner -- towards her.
Tension.
JANA
Hello.. 
He slowly approaches the dark corner. 31."
"32.She moves around the pillar -- eyes on him -- gets ready to 
pounce on him --
NARENDRA (O.S.)
Eyy Jana--
Jana turns around.
Watching her prey recede, She slinks back into her dark 
corner.
LIVING ROOM
The room is flooded with light.
The boys cheer.
UPSTAIRS BEDROOM
Beaming from ear to ear, Narendra enters the bedroom.
Sees the lady standing in the shadows in a corner of the 
room.
NARENDRA
The fuse is back on. Come on, now. 
The lady at the window doesn't move.
Tension.
UPSTAIRS BATHROOM
The door opens. Lady steps out. She walks up to the bedroom. 
Obviously she’s not the woman in the bedroom!
UPSTAIRS BEDROOM
More Tension.
Narendra is surprised, realizing it is not the Lady.
NARENDRA
Hello..
The woman at the window comes closer to Narendra -- and he 
sees her face (we don’t). His expression changes to terror!
Boom.
He falls to the ground -- like somebody pulled his feet from 
under him -- and he gets dragged along the floor, very fast -- 
smashes the window pane and disappears outside.32."
"33.At that moment Lady enters -- sees the window shattering -- 
maybe she catches a glimpse of a body flying out, can’t 
really tell.
And screams.
LIVING ROOM
Vicky is the first to react. He jumps and runs up the stairs.
Everybody in the hall is startled. Scared even.
BEDROOM
Vicky, followed by others, enters the room.
Lady is staring out the window, screaming. She points at 
something.
LADY
There.. There.. Oh my god!
(sheer terror in her eyes)
Vicky tries to spot what she is showing, but can’t. It’s too 
dark.
VICKY
What? Where?
LADY
There he is.. There he is.. Oh my 
god!
He grabs her --
VICKY
What happened?
LADY
(gasping)
Stree.. Stree..
VICKY
Stree what?
LADY
She took your friend!
What?!
EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT
They all walk around the house in groups -- shining 
flashlights -- calling out for Narendra.
Vicky, Bittu, Jana form one posse. Other such groups.
They look into shrubs, inside sheds..33."
"34.Finally they all converge again at the front of the house.
No sign of Narendra. But Vicky spots something in the bushes. 
Narendra’s clothes.
VICKY
These are Narendra’s clothes.
BITTU
His underwear is also here.
JANA
What is he doing roaming around 
naked?
BITTU
Shit! Stree got him.
VICKY
What the hell?
BITTU
Guys, let’s analyze this logically. 
Narendra is gone. His clothes are 
here. 
(beat)
Stree got him. What else could have 
happened? That’s the only 
explanation.
VICKY
(glares at him)
Or.. The moron did some shitty 
drugs, jumped out of the window, 
and is roaming around naked 
somewhere.
(adds)
How about that for an explanation?
Beat.
BITTU
I like my story better.
The other guys also all nod in agreement.
They all look at the clothes lying on the ground.
BALA
Actually I agree with Vicky. I 
don’t think Stree would have come 
into the house. There is the 
inscription on the wall.
Everybody nods.
VICKY
Well..34."
"35.AT THE WALL
On Bala, as he stares. From behind him Bittu peeks in. 
Followed by Jana. And others.
BALA
How the fuck did this happen?
BITTU
(reads aloud)
O stree.. Aana.
The message on the wall is an unmistakable invitation. 
BITTU
Who did this?
Vicky is guilty.
BITTU
The fuck is wrong with you!
BALA
So you basically put a red carpet 
out for her to come inside.
VICKY
Guys, you don’t really believe all 
this--
A squabble breaks out. Ending in nothing.
TOWN - DAY
It’s a bright day. Laidback streets of the town.
INT. TAILORING SHOP - DAY
Women try on clothes.
A hungover Vicky pedalling the sewing machine at a lower 
pace.
Disturbing the peace --
EXT. TAILOR SHOP LANE - DAY
3 sporty bikes, the inexpensive ones with cool contours, roar 
into the lane and pull up in front of the shop. Three ‘cool 
dudes’ are on them. Followed by a sad-ass bike with Jana and 
Bittu. 
The women outside throw nasty glances at the dudes.
Vicky’s father shakes his head.
DAD
Jobless buffalos!35."
"36.Vicky looks outside. Curious at the visitors, he steps out. 
Bittu and Jana quickly come to Vicky --
JANA
Narendra’s gang.
Narendra’s friends put their shades on, walk up to Vicky and 
stare at him.
It’s face-off of sorts as the three taller, cooler gang line 
up a foot away from the faces of Vicky, Bittu and Jana. The 
leader of the DURGA PRASAD startes Vicky down.
DURGA PRASAD
Where’s our friend?
Vicky matches up to the coolness, even if dressed in a vest.
VICKY
Which one?
COOL GUY 2
You know which one.
COOL GUY 3
The one that came to your party.
DURGA PRASAD
The one that-
VICKY
Arre direct naam bolo na. Yeh kyun 
KBC khel raha hai..
DURGA PRASAD
(beat)
Narendra.
VICKY
(quickly)
No idea. He came. He made noise. 
And he left.
DURGA PRASAD
But you. You let Stree inside.
VICKY
What!?
COOL GUY 2
You peed on the writing! And 
invited her in. 
VICKY
You guys are crazy. I have work to 
do. (adds) How do you know all this 
shit anyway?
They look at Bittu.36."
"37.Vicky stares at Bittu - ‘What the hell!’
One of the cool guys gets a call and nods to others. 
DURGA PRASAD
You better hope we find him. Or 
else..
Vicky gestures like - ‘Or else what?’
He thinks for a second. Doesn’t have an answer. They just get 
on their bikes to go.
COOL GUY 2
You have no idea how high our 
connections go!
They drive away loudly.
VICKY
So then ask the connections to find 
your friend. 
(adds)
It’s my pee. I will pee wherever 
the hell I want.
Vicky then slowly turns to Bittu and stares at him.
BITTU
They tortured me. And threatened to 
hurt me. 
JANA
Bullshit. They didn’t even finish 
asking their question and this 
bugger blurted out everything.
VICKY
(shakes his head)
I sometimes wonder how you are my 
best friend!
Just then an auto pulls up -- Lady from last night emerges.
VICKY
What the hell is she doing here??
JANA
Oh yeah.. She wants to get paid.
VICKY
For what?
Lady comes up --
LADY
Your friend never paid me. 
VICKY
So how’s that our problem!37."
"38.LADY
It was your party.
VICKY
Says who! It wasn’t even my house. 
LADY
But you peed on it.
VICKY
What the hell! Why is everyone 
after my pee!??
LADY
Just give me my money that was 
promised. 
BITTU
But he didn’t even do friendship. 
He didn’t have time for friendship!
JANA
Yeah, he’s probably doing 
friendship with Stree right now!
LADY
I don’t care. You better pay me..
VICKY 
Why me??
INSIDE THE SHOP
Old Cashier beckons Dad --’psst’. Dad looks up. 
He nods -- pointing outside. They both curiously watch.
DAD’S POV - Vicky shakes his head, looks around and pays cash 
to the Lady.
Old Cashier shakes his head disapprovingly at Dad.
INT. TAILOR SHOP - MOMENTS LATER
Vicky is going back to his station when his Dad catches his 
eye. He beckons his son, with a very subtle gesture. 
Vicky is unsure. Dad gestures to him again and points to the 
other room. 
Cautiously, Vicky enters the store room. 
Dad comes and closes the door behind them. 
DAD
Son, I need to tell you something.
(Vicky’s bracing)
Your mother was an angel. May God 
bless her soul wherever she is. 38."
"39.VICKY
Matlab, she’s alive somewhere!?
DAD
(shakes his head)
VICKY
Tsk! Father, why do you keep 
changing the backstory every time!
DAD
Son.. Son.. Listen. Before you were 
born even I did friendship with 
your mother.
VICKY
What!?? You don’t know what that 
word means..
DAD
Listen to me please.
(shushes Vicky)
Purush aur aurat ka milan hota 
hai.. It’s of very high importance! 
The union of the two bodies is 
embodiment of heaven and earth 
coming together. Of shakti and 
shiv. Of Pran shakti and-
VICKY
Why are you getting granthik on me 
now!??
DAD
I don’t know what you guys are up 
to these days with friendship and 
girlfriends.. But the union of man 
and woman is sacred, my son.
(adds)
And you can choose a more deserving 
lady to share your male-energy with-
VICKY
(fully awkward)
Aaah! Dad stop it! 
(realizes)
Oh you saw me giving money to that 
woman outside??
DAD
Even though I shouldn’t be advising 
this, I don’t mind you discovering 
yourself by yourself than with 
women of the night. 
VICKY
Are you serious!?39."
"40.DAD
I can buy 10GB data on your phone 
so you can indulge once a week or 
preferably once a month.. in self-
discovery.
Vicky cannot control his father anymore. He walks out on him 
abruptly.
PEACEFUL SPOT
Vicky takes a break, a breather to clear his head. Smoking.
On cue the assistant comes out to call him in, but Vicky is 
too quick to shush him and shunt him back in.
Vicky inhales his smoke and takes a deep breath.
Suddenly he smells this bewitchingly familiar smell. He turns 
around and --
Nothing.
But something catches his eye. It’s a letter. Fluttering, 
placed under a stone.
Curious, he picks it up.
And opens it --
EXT. SARASWAT FAST FOOD CENTRE - DAY
BITTU
My dear Vicky..
All three friends are reading the letter.
JANA
Done! Right there.. ‘My dear!’ It’s 
all set my friend! Badhaai ho!
Vicky nods bashfully.
BITTU
‘My dear Vicky, How are you?’
(adds)
That’s dumb. She knows how you are 
but still asking how you are.
JANA
Abey.. Tu bus padh na. Side 
commentary kyun?
BITTU
‘I am glad I met you. I cherish 
every meeting of ours.’
-- looks at Vicky, who grins --40."
"41.BITTU
‘And I relish our deep 
conversations that we share.’
-- Vicky is not sure about that, but still takes it --
BITTU
‘I hope we can meet again and 
again. One more thing. Can you 
please get me the following?’
JANA
Kya!??
Everyone reacts similarly.
BITTU
‘1 quarter brandy, 1/2 kg mutton, a 
kilo of ground glass, matchbox, 
wild flowers, safed billi ki baal, 
tail of a lizard’.
WTF!!
BITTU
‘Thanking you. Affectionately.’
A moment of silent bewilderment, as everybody tries to 
comprehend the strange letter.
BITTU
What the fuck! It’s a mental 
shopping list!
JANA
Why does she need these weird 
stuff?
They ponder for a second.
JANA
So what are you going to do?
VICKY
(beat)
I mean, pyaar se poochi hai toh.. 
JANA
Toh??
VICKY
(hesitantly)
Laane padenge na..
BITTU
Are you serious??41."
"42.VICKY
Listen.. If a girl comes up to you 
and asks for something, whatever 
the hell it is.. will you do it or 
not??
Long beat.
QUIRKY MUSIC starts --
AROUND TOWN - DAY
Vicky mainly, and his weirded out friends go around town and 
buy the stuff from the shopping list --
-- Liquor shop
-- Meat shop
-- Raddi shop to buy broken glass
-- Machinist to ground the glass into powder
-- Florist for some roses
-- Wooded area for wild flowers
-- Vicky diligently checks each item off the list.
Couple more items left --
BACKYARD
Vicky, Bittu and jana are staring at what seems like a 
ridiculous task.
They are looking at -- a fierce looking cat.
Vicky is a little unsure.
JANA
Go for it.
(beat)
Ab iss mein sharmaana kya hai? 
BITTU
Yeah go go..
CUT TO:
Vicky is running around the cat. And it’s not a friendly one. 
It’s actually turning and snarling at its pursuer.
Vicky’s Dad is also watching at this strange visual from 
inside the shop. 
CUT TO:
Vicky is triumphant as he spits out some of the hair. 42."
"43.Jana pats him for a job well done. Then points to --
A lizard on the roof. 
CUT TO:
Bittu and Jana are chilling and sipping tea, while in the 
background Vicky is running after the jumpy lizard. 
They are lost in existential discussion --
BITTU
You think this is normal?
JANA
Define normal.
BITTU
Abey.. Don’t get philosophical now. 
Does this look normal to you.
JANA
Maybe not the lizard part. Other 
stuff I kinda understand I guess.
BITTU
How?
JANA
(casually)
The girl likes her meat. And can 
handle her drink.
(beat)
I actually dig her. I think she’s 
quite cool.
BITTU
You idiot. These are not normal 
stuff anyone would do. There’s 
something weird about her. I can 
feel it. 
The lizard falls on Vicky. He yelps and jumps around. 
BITTU
Definitely something strange.
VICKY (O.S.)
I am ok! Got it!
JANA
(casually nods)
Yeah.
EXT. TOWN - CUTAWAY
Life goes on in the town.43."
"44.INT. VICKY’S HOUSE - EVENING
Vicky is getting ready in a hurry. He’s trying to look as 
cool as possible.
He realizes his dad is perambulating outside his room. He 
quickly shuts the door. 
Vicky puts on final touches, sprays perfume liberally on 
himself. 
And steps out.
Of course, his dad is across the hall. They stare at each 
other. 
Dad beckons him with his head. Vicky shakes his head like - 
‘No it’s ok.’
Dad persists. Vicky goes up to him.
Dad can smell his son’s perfume. He then gives Vicky a small 
plastic cover. 
Vicky dreads opening it. But is forced to check the contents.
It’s got some cash, Hanuman Chalisa, a new SIM card --
DAD
10GB..
-- And a condom.
Shit! Akward!
DAD
Har option tere haath mein hain.
Hold on Vicky.
SARASWAT FAST FOOD CENTRE
Bittu and Jana are nicely dressed up too. Bittu is on the 
phone. Hangs up. 
BITTU
Vicky is not answering the phone.
JANA
I wonder why.
BITTU
100% he has gone to meet that girl. 
And he is totally avoiding us.
JANA
And we must not let him?44."
"45.BITTU
Exactly.
(then)
Are you not seeing what I am 
saying?
JANA
Which is what exactly?
BITTU
This girl.. She appears only once a 
year in this town. Exactly during 
the puja time - same as our Stree. 
And then she disappears.
(adds)
Then she asks for scary bizarre 
shopping list that is sounding like 
the shit used in black magic.
(adds)
Nobody knows much about her. Nobody 
has seen her I am sure except our 
friend!
JANA
So what are you saying?
BITTU
She is the Stree!!
They silently ponder this petrifying thought. 
EXT. TEMPLE - EVENING
Vicky is waiting. Fidgety. Making sure he looks dashing. 
She’s nowhere in sight. 
He hears aarti bells from inside. So he decides to make a 
dash for it and quickly prays to the Gods and rushes back. 
Still no sign of her.
Some random person gives him prasad also. He takes it 
hesitantly. On second thoughts he asks for an extra peda.
BIKE ON TOWN STREETS - EVENING
JANA
Shit!
BITTU
Exactly. 
JANA
This is the shit men get into when 
they fall into the web of women..45."
"46.BITTU
Especially when they ditch their 
friends!
Jana tries Vicky’s number again. It’s still switched off.
JANA
We must get to Vicky before she 
does!
EXT. TEMPLE - SAME TIME
As Vicky waits, he pulls out his cool headphones and tries to 
act like he’s chilling. He switches on his phone to play a 
song but it immediately rings - it’s Jana. And he immediately 
shuts it down.
But still acts like music is playing on his headphones, and 
bobs his head, like he’s lost in some cool music.
Tension slowly builds up. Crescendoes until --
VOICE
Hi!
Vicky puts on an act like he can’t hear because of the music.
Gayatri comes close. Vicky takes his headphones off.
VICKY
Oh hey! Sorry I was kinda.. lost in 
music. 
GAYATRI
Cool!
VICKY
You just got here?
(off of her nod)
You missed the aarti again!
GAYATRI
Oh no! I missed it again!
BIKE ON STREETS - SAME TIME
BITTU
I am sure he’s not seeing any of 
the signs!
JANA
He’s blinded by the lure of a 
woman!46."
"47.EXT. TEMPLE - SAME TIME
VICKY
(sweetly)
Here’s some Prasad for you.
(gives her the peda)
GAYATRI
Oh.. So sweet. But.. It’s ok. I am 
fasting today.
VICKY
Oh ok.. 
(pops that sweet into his 
mouth too)
We can go in now if you want. I 
know the assistant priest. I can 
get him to do a small aarti for you-
GAYATRI
Is that for me?
(points to the bag)
VICKY
Yes! (proudly) I.. I got all the 
stuff you asked for! Umm.. I hope 
goat’s mutton is ok. You didn’t 
tell me which brand of brandy, so I 
got 3-4 kinds. You can have 
whatever you like. Also the billi 
na.. poora safed nahi mila. Matlab 
it was white in patches. Hope 
that’s ok..
(then)
Anyway.. Why do you need all these--
Gayatri places her hand in his shoulder --
GAYATRI
Let’s go somewhere na.
VICKY
(oh!)
GAYATRI
Let’s go somewhere quiet and sit. 
And talk.
(adds)
Do you know of any place? 
Vicky thinks --
BIKE ON STREETS - SAME TIME
BITTU
I know all the lovers spots that he 
can go to. Let’s check all of them!47."
"48.EXT. TEMPLE - SAME TIME
Vicky is still thinking --
VICKY
Shit! They know all the spots.
Gayatri smiles at Vicky muttering. She takes charge--
GAYATRI
Come.
She takes his hand. And pulls him along with her. 
The world slows down for Vicky. 
A SWEET BUT HAUNTING MELODY plays over --
Sweet visuals of them walking away in slow motion. She leads 
him out of the area. And he lets her lead him.
They go through the streets dressed in pretty lights and 
through people, dressed up for the temple. 
They also walk through guys dressed up in drag.
She hails a shared tempo.
And they get on it.
BIKE
Bittu and Jana reach the temple.
No sign of Vicky.
BITTU
They’re not here. Let’s go.
TEMPO
The song continues as Gayatri and Vicky travel in shared 
tempo. 
Gayatri finally lets go of Vicky’s hand.
It’s a sweet, shy moment for Vicky as they travel with 
others. It’s a slightly intimate moment in a crowded tempo.
Their shoulders rub. They sneak looks at each other. Of 
course, some co-passengers also sneak a look at them. 
To add to it all, the brandy bottles clink in the bag. 
MEANWHILE
His friends are trying to look for him at various places.48."
"49.As the MUSIC COMES TO AN END --
DOOSRI RAAT
LONE SPOT - OUTSKIRTS
Vicky and Gayatri get off at the outskirts. There’s no soul 
around.
Gayatri leads him to an isolated spot.
It’s romantic if you are in that mood. Or it’s bloody scary 
if you are not. 
The full moon is the only light source.
Gayatri beckons Vicky to sit next to her. He complies.
She smiles at him. He smiles back. Except he’s also a bit 
nervous. Then --
VICKY
How do you know this place?
She shrugs.
He then sees at a distance -- a burning pyre. It’s a burial 
ground close by!
VICKY
(worried)
Why this place?
She looks at him blankly.
GAYATRI
It’s peaceful.
Wtf! Vicky is spooked. Then she suddenly smiles. Vicky is 
relieved. 
She drops her smile abruptly. Vicky’s relief freezes too. 
GAYATRI
So what all do you stitch in your 
shop? Mainly lehengas and stuff?
VICKY
No no. We do complete ladies 
fashions and stylings.
(adds)
Ghagra, Lehenga, Chudidaar, 
Patiala, Anarkali, Classic 
Salwaars, Pakistani Salwaars, Long 
Kurti, Short Kurti, Garara, 
Sharara.. Of course blouses are my 
speciality. Deep neck, back deep, 
designer blouse, model blouse 
katori blouse--49."
"50.OUTSKIRTS
Bittu and Jana have now come out of town and looking around 
if they should venture more. 
BITTU
I think we should just head home.
JANA
Why? You getting scared?
BITTU
No! I am just like.. Now tired of 
looking for this.. this selfish 
guy.. 
It’s eerily quiet. They both feel it. 
JANA
Yeah.. I think we should go bac--
Suddenly the bike dies. 
That freaks them out. 
LONE SPOT
VICKY
We also do western suits, tops, 
skirts, frocks, gowns, housecoats, 
embroidery, stone work, mirror 
work, darning, nighties, falls..
(beat)
That’s it I think.
GAYATRI
(beat)
When are you going to give me my 
lehenga?
VICKY
Oh.. Sorry, I got busy with your.. 
shopping..
GAYATRI
I am sorry that I made you..
VICKY
No no.. It’s ok. 
He gets distracted by Gayatri’s beauty in the moonlight.
VICKY
Actually I didn’t take your 
measurements properly.
GAYATRI
I thought.. (she taps her forehead)50."
"51.VICKY
(smiles)
Yeah, I always get it right. But 
for the first time, just in your 
case, I think I got the 
measurements wrong. 
Gayatri looks at him. Smiles. Then drops the smile.
GAYATRI
Toh ab le lo.
What!
VICKY
Umm.. I don’t have a tape..
GAYATRI
Do you need a tape?
Vicky smiles. Shyly.
Gayatri gestures like - ‘I am serious.’
The SONG restarts --
Vicky tentatively gets up and slowly starts off measuring her 
hands first - using his fingers and hands. 
It turns into an intimate moment as he measures her all 
around. 
Suddenly, the cloud around the moon clears off. 
Gayatri looks up. Then she turns to Vicky -- picks up the 
shopping bag -- gestures to him that she’ll be back. And 
takes off. 
Vicky is clueless as to what just happened.
All he knows is he’s suddenly all alone in the middle of 
nowhere, with a burial ground around.
LANE IN THE WOODS - NIGHT
Bittu kicks the starter of his bike. No use.
BITTU
Shit!
JANA
How can you not put petrol again?!
You and your dad -- want to hoard 
every penny.
BITTU
I didn’t think we would roam so 
much on it.51."
"52.JANA
Shit!
They look around -- they are all alone in this sinister 
night.
JANA
What do we do now?
BITTU
(thinks)
Go to the petrol bunk in town and 
get some petrol.
JANA
What do you mean go? Both of us, 
right? 
BITTU
Who’ll look after the bike?
JANA
We can push the bike and go.
BITTU
It’s 5 KM to town by the main road! 
We’ll die pushing. You go by this 
shortcut, it’ll be faster.
JANA
I’m not going alone.
BITTU
Then you stay here, I’ll go.
Beat.
Jana looks at the woods around. 
Scary. Eerie.
JANA
Uh.. I’ll go.
BITTU
OK, come back soon.
Jana starts to walk.
LONE SPOT
Vicky patiently waits. It’s been a while. Everything around 
him looks terrifying.
He gently calls out --
VICKY
Hello..
(realizes, mutters)
Shit, I don’t even know her name!52."
"53.Beat.
Suddenly a flutter -- as a bunch of birds flee their coop.
Startling Vicky.
Shit!
The howl of a dog in the distance.
He walks in the direction Gayatri went. 
A few metres, and he sees a broken gate leading to --
SHAMSHAAN
Quite scared now, he enters the gate.
VICKY
(softly)
Hello...
-- no response.
He walks on through the graves. 
There’s a burning pyre in the distance.
DESERTED ROAD
Jana walks -- scared shitless. Looking around him for 
anything suspicious.
A rustle in the woods -- startles him -- he jumps out of his 
skin.
Nothing. Must be some wild animal.
He walks on.
PARKED BIKE
Bittu is scared too. Tries hard to peer into the woods -- to 
see if anyone -- anything -- is lurking around.
A hum.
Thoroughly scared, he trains his ear. 
The hum intensifies. 
It’s getting closer.
Tension.
The hum is getting really close now. Bittu anxiously has his 
eyes peeled in the direction of the sound.53."
"54.Suddenly a light -- around the corner -- heading towards him. 
It’s a scooter.
Bittu is relieved. Thank God!
He waves to the guy to stop.
The scooter drives right by him -- the driver is just fixated 
on the road -- doesn’t even blink. Doesn’t even acknowledge 
Bittu and his bike by the roadside. 
He just drives on. Like nothing.
Like he’s a ghost. Or Bittu is a ghost!
Bittu is more scared now! Rudra’s warning from last night --
RUDRA (V.O.)
Never venture out alone. The safest 
place for a man is inside your four 
walls.
Bittu shudders.
DESERTED ROAD
Jana walks briskly, jumping at every noise and rustle. 
And suddenly finds himself at --
CROSSROADS - NIGHT
Jana remembers Rudra’s warning from last night.
RUDRA (V.O.)
Beware of crossroads. Those are her 
favourite haunts. 
He feels a chill. 
RUDRA (V.O.)
Try to be as quiet as possible. 
Remove your slippers, the noise 
attracts her.
Jana quickly removes his footwear. Starts tiptoeing.
Tension.
He takes a few steps, when --
HER VOICE
Janaaa..
He stops. A chill runs up his spine.
RUDRA (V.O.)
DO NOT look back. 54."
"55.He takes a deep breath and starts to walk.
HER VOICE
Janaaaaa...
-- it’s sweeter this time. More sensual.
Jana is on the verge of tears.
RUDRA (V.O.)
Keep walking. Don’t run, just walk.
Jana starts to recits the Hanuman Chalisa, as he picks up 
pace and walks. Gets stuck after the first stanza. Starts 
repeating the same lines.
HER VOICE
Janaaaaaaaaaaa..
-- this time it’s practically in his ears. Like she is right 
next to him.
Fuck!
He slowly starts to turn back --
RUDRA (V.O.)
Aaj tak aisa mard paida nahi hua, 
who can resist her voice. Everybody 
turns back.
-- he turns to face her.
In the middle of the crossroads, Jana stands facing Her. 
This is the first time we see her.
A quiet, shy bride draped in a sari, head bent, ghunghat 
down, covering her eyes. She is demure and scary at the same 
time. 
Gingerly, he slowly tries to bend to see her face, her eyes. 
And she too reciprocates by slowly lifting her bent head.
Intercut between the two, as they try to look at each other. 
Her POV and his POV. 
Anticipation. Tension. 
And finally we see her face! In the shadowy darkness. The 
outline of a pretty girl’s face.
Jana’s expression softens. 
Boom! 
Suddenly the face turns ghostly! And lets out a piercing 
sound as she pounces on Jana. 
Jana is dragged along the ground by his legs -- very fast, 
like a bullet. He screams in pain.55."
"56.And a moment later, they’re gone.
Beat.
Along the path, further down -- Jana’s clothes lie, including 
his undies.
INTERVAL
EXT. TOWN ROADS - DAY
A rickshaw fitted with loudspeakers makes its rounds.
ANNOUNCER
All the townsfolk are hereby 
warned. Men are not safe on the 
streets after dark. They are 
advised to stay indoors at night 
and not venture outside. We repeat, 
men are not safe at nights. 
(adds)
Stree is on the prowl!
Inside the rickshaw are the Announcer and Rudra. 
ANNOUNCER
Here are some of the rules by the 
resident expert on Stree.
He hands over the mic noisily. Rudra proudly takes the mic --  
clears his throat into the mic itself --  taps on it -- does 
a mic check and everything. Then, he reads out of a paper 
that is titled ‘Rules of Stree.’
RUDRA
To be safe from Stree, please 
follow the following rules. 
Otherwise she will take you away 
and suck you bloody dry and shit--
Announcer asks him to go easy --
ANNOUNCER
Please don’t get emotional. This is 
for family audience.
RUDRA
(nods and continues)
Rule number 1. Write on the walls - 
O Stree, Kal Aana. Don’t get cute 
with variations. Stick to exactly 
that. Don’t be stingy, pay the 
watchmen to write with their 
special mixture. 
2. If you have to go out in the 
nights, go in groups, or go with a 
female escort.. and avoid 
crossroads. 
3. The most important rule! 56."
"57.In case you encounter Stree, one 
thing you must never ever do is-- 
(voice becomes inaudible)
Rudra taps the mike -- it has stopped working. 
And no one gets to hear this main rule again!
INT. JANA’S HOUSE
Loud wailing of JANA’S MOM submerges Rudra’s announcements.
JANA’S MOM
..that bloody Stree has taken my 
kid. And he’s still a virgin. He 
won’t even be able to stand her 
ferocity!
Not everyone’s crying as much as her. They are a little 
dumbfounded by the happenings. She then eyes Vicky and Bittu--
JANA’S MOM
It’s all because of these idiot 
friends. My dear Jana doesn’t even 
look at a girl with buri nazar. 
They spoiled him completely with 
drinks and night-shows and dirty 
pictures.. and.. and friendships!
(adds)
Did you even go to the temple??
Bittu is directly in her line of sight. And Vicky is trying 
to hide his face next to Jana’s Dad. 
JANA’S DAD
(in low tones to Vicky )
Tell me the truth. Why were his 
clothes left behind? What is this 
friendship you guys are into these 
days?? 
Vicky doesn’t know what to say. He diverts --
VICKY
Uncle.. All this Stree stuff is 
nonsense. I think we should 
register a police complaint that 
Jana’s missing. 
A couple of others around them nod their head in agreement. 
But a couple are pessimistic. 
VISITOR 1
Once Stree gets you, there’s no 
coming back. (shakes his head 
hopelessly) Woh toh gaya.
Dad and Vicky look at the guy like - ‘Are you serious?’ The 
visitor bites his tongue and shuts up. 57."
"58.EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY
Prominent sign says ‘POLICE STATION’. Equally prominently, 
written on the wall below is: O Stree Kal Aana.
INSIDE
CONSTABLE
What’s your complaint?
VICKY
Sir, our friend.. Actually two 
friends.. are missing.
CONSTABLE
Achcha.. What are their names?
BITTU
Sir, Stree took them.
The cop stares at them. Then he shakes his head like there’s 
no hope and gets up.
CONSTABLE
Stree abductions are handled by 
head constable.
Vicky is dismayed.
WIPE TO:
The HEAD CONSTABLE is looking at Bittu and Vicky.
HEAD CONSTABLE
Why were you guys wandering around 
in the middle of the night?? And 
why the hell didn’t you write on 
the walls?
VICKY
Sir, how can you guys believe in 
all this shit--
BITTU
It was written sir. But he wiped it 
off. 
(points to Vicky)
The constable pipes in --
CONSTABLE
Why the hell??
BITTU
He peed on it.
HEAD CONSTABLE
Wtf!58."
"59.BITTU
He actually peed only on one word 
deliberately and wiped if off with 
all the beer-piss. Just one word - 
Kal.
CONSTABLE
(puts it together)
So it then read - O Stree.. Aana???
BITTU
You are correct, Sir. 
Constable holds up his finger for Bittu to pause and shouts 
across to his colleagues.
CUT TO:
All the cops in the station are now staring at these two. And 
they can’t contain their laughs.
CONSTABLE
(elaborates)
..so it read - ‘O stree.. piss piss 
piss.. Aaana!’
They all laugh.
HEAD CONSTABLE
What death wish do you have? Why 
the hell did you screw with the 
writing?!!
CONSTABLE
He basically invited her into the 
house.. Rose water daal ke.
(corrects)
Matlab, pee water daal ke.
VICKY
(shakes his head)
I can’t believe that everyone 
believes in this cock and bull 
legend!
(turns to Bittu)
Then what about Jana?? He wasn’t 
even in the house. 
BITTU
(beat)
Mistaken identity. I think she was 
looking for you!
Vicky raps him on his head --
VICKY
Sometimes I wonder how are you even 
my friend!?59."
"60.BITTU
(is sorry)
I am just.. giving all the facts so 
it will help in the investigation.
VICKY
Yeah right. (gestures - Let’s get 
out of here)
AROUND TOWN - DAY
MUSIC DRIVEN SHOTS of Stree related frenzy in the town --
-- Rudra goes around in an auto-rickshaw, distributing 
pamphlets with rules of Stree on them. Kids run after it.
-- People have gathered in groups, discussing the horrors of 
the night.
GUY 1
When will men be safe in this 
country!?
(what?)
Matlab.. In this town!
GUY 2
I heard that Stree is especially 
ferocious this time. I heard it’s 
looking for something specific. 
Maybe it’s found a scent.
GUY 3
But one thing I believe is that the 
guy who she takes, gets maximum 
pleasure before of course she 
devours him. 
GUY 2
You mean like scorpions? Where the 
female kills and eats the male 
after having sex.
GUY 1
Wah bhai.. Agar jaana hai toh aise 
jaana hai!
GUY 3
Are you crazy, at the end of it you 
die, you idiot!
OUTSIDE TEMPLE
There’s a board that says ‘Special Puja for protection from 
Stree Rs 150/-’.
PRIEST
She’s nothing but the ansh of the 
Goddess herself! 
(does namaskaar to the 
heavens)60."
"61.TOWN SQUARE
A crowd has gathered to listen to a very enthused MLA.
MLA
..I will personally award 10,000 
rupees for every person found..
(round of applause)
And I will award 10 lakh rupees to 
whoever gets rid of Stree itself!
(louder applause)
And I will name this chowk with his 
name.
(bigger applause, he’s 
even more fired up)
and I will--
-- the Secretary interrupts and tells him to control himself.
MLA
(calms down)
Ok that’s it. Those are all the 
things I will do. Thank you.
Vicky and Bittu are also watching this. 
ONLOOKER
(shakes his head)
Paagal hai! Once She’s taken them, 
there’s no coming back! 
ONLOOKER 2
Where do you think she’s storing 
all those people??
ONLOOKER 3
How does she know everyone’s names?
ONLOOKER
Maybe everyone’s tracked.*
ONLOOKER 2
Who is she exactly? 
ONLOOKER
Arre.. It’s a very long story. 
ANOTHER GUY
She was a witch!
ANOTHER GUY
No no.. She was a queen..
ANOTHER GUY
Bullshit.. She’s not from this 
world.
Vicky and Bittu decide enough is enough and leave.61."
"62.BIKE ON ROAD
Bittu drives, Vicky rides behind him.
BITTU
Tell me again, exactly where were 
you yesterday?
VICKY
By the old bridge.
BITTU
Oh! At the shamshan?
VICKY
No. At the bridge.
BITTU
The bridge by the shamshan.
VICKY
Yes..
BITTU
Hmmm.. Was she with you all the 
time?
VICKY
Yeah..
(then slowly concedes)
Actually she left suddenly. And.. 
never came back.
BITTU
What! Around what time??
VICKY
Around 1030.. 11.. I think..
Bittu stops the bike and --
BITTU
(emphatically shouts)
I knew it!!
VICKY
What!?
BITTU
Don’t you get it?? She comes at 
exactly the same time as Stree 
roams the streets. She asks for 
black magic shit. She doesn’t even 
have a mobile phone yaar! Who 
doesn’t these days?!
(beat)
And last night she went off into 
the shamsham to do God knows what..
(shushing Vicky’s protest)
..at exactly the same time Jana 
went missing! 
(adds coyly)62."
"63.And some weird shit was happening 
around me and spooked the hell out 
of me.
(beat)
You see what I am seeing?
VICKY
That you’re jealous that I have a 
girlfriend and you don’t?
BITTU
(rubbishes it, presses on)
Tell me something. Has anyone else 
besides you even seen this girl? I 
know I haven’t.
Vicky ponders briefly --
FLASHBACK: HIS PEACEFUL SPOT --
-- Gayatri leaves and instantly the assistant comes beckoning 
him.
FLASHBACK: OUTSIDE TEMPLE --
-- He’s with Gayatri. A GUY entering the temple nods to 
Vicky, and enters the temple -- without so much as a glance 
at Gayatri. 
BACK --
On Vicky. Shit.
Bittu raises his arms like he won.
BITTU
I knew it!
(beat)
She is Stree!!
Beat.
Vicky is lost in thought.
BITTU
But the only thing I don’t 
understand is, how come she comes 
to the temple? Aren’t bhooth-pret 
supposed to be afraid of God and 
stuff?
Vicky looks up, already given up, sad.
VICKY
Actually she never entered the 
temple. We always stayed outside. 
And she didn’t take the prasad.63."
"64.Bittu nods sympathetically, softens his tone.
BITTU
Think about it, Vicky. I know you 
don’t believe in all this. But you 
fell in love.. with a bloody ghost! 
(chokes)
And she took our poor Jana! 
(beat)
If she’s really your lover, why 
don’t you go and ask her to give 
our Jana back.
(beat)
And don’t tell her I told you all 
this! Then she might come after me 
too!
Long hold on a disturbed Vicky.
ENERGETIC MUSIC starts --
TAILOR SHOP - DAY
Still disturbed, Vicky hits the pedal on the tailoring 
machine like a possessed man. He’s lost in deep thought.
Oblivious to him, Vicky’s father, Old Cashier and others stop 
their work, transfixed at the incredible talent at play!
Vicky is going at it full speed, like a machine. 
Then he cuts and snips and twirls and folds and.. The outfit 
is done.
The assistant checks his watch. Vicky just set a new record!
Dad is overcome with pride. Everyone is stunned.
But Vicky is not aware of any of this.
He takes a plastic bag, flicks it open in style, shoves the 
outfit in and gets out of there. 
HIS PEACEFUL SPOT
As the ENERGETIC MUSIC ends --
Vicky finds himself at his peaceful spot. He sits with the 
garment bag placed next to him.
A sense of unease comes over him.
The atmosphere slowly turns eerie. 
As if on cue the sun goes behind the clouds suddenly it’s 
much darker now. 
Vicky finds this unnerving. 64."
"65.Rather suddenly --
GAYATRI
You finished it!
Vicky is startled. He jumps.
GAYATRI
(surprised, suspicious)
What happened? 
VICKY
Er.. Um.. Nothing.. I just..
-- his gaze shifts to her feet. 
And he notices for the first time. Her feet have unusually 
bloody veins, almost like cracks running aong her legs.
Looks scary!
He slowly lifts his gaze from her feet to her face.
And guess what! She’s staring at him with intense eyes.
He almost jumps at the scary visual.
Her lips part in a smile -- an evil smile. And the smile 
becomes wider and wider - unnaturally wide.
Then her face begins to turn. It turns into something 
grotesque. An evil beast.
And she lunges at him.
Vicky screams as he falls back.
GAYATRI
You finished it!
Instantly everything snaps back to normal. Not dark any more.
And there she is -- Gayatri standing sweetly.
Vicky realizes he’s lying weirdly on the bench. He forces a 
weird smile at her.
GAYATRI
What happened?
VICKY
Er.. Um.. Nothing.
GAYATRI
You look like you saw a ghost.
VICKY
What?.. No.. No..
She picks up the garment bag.65."
"66.GAYATRI
Thank you so much! How much--
VICKY
(still nervous)
It’s free.
GAYATRI
Really?
VICKY
Yes yes.. Free for you.
GAYATRI
But your dad--
VICKY
Kya karlega? I’ll figure something.
GAYATRI
Wow.. Thank you for the gift then!
(Pats his arm. Then-)
You want to go out somewhere and--
VICKY
Yahin par theek hai.
GAYATRI
Ok!
And she sits next to him. She takes out the dress and starts 
marveling at it while Vicky is looking at her very closely. 
Checking her eyes, ears, hair.. And especially the feet, 
which for some reason are again completely covered by her 
long skirt.
GAYATRI
I like your clothes.
VICKY
What?
GAYATRI
Your clothes. What you’re wearing. 
Did you stitch them yourself too?
Vicky instinctively holds his shirt together -- like she will 
snatch it from his body any time --
VICKY
No. Readymade.
GAYATRI
(now fully suspicious)
Is something the matter?
Beat. Vicky shakes his head. She stares.
Then -- he calms himself down, musters courage.66."
"67.VICKY
Actually, Umm.. Actually I don’t 
know if you’ve heard but there’s a 
woman supposed to be going around 
at night. Stree. And for some odd 
reason she’s like snatching up 
people it seems. 
(feels low)
In fact my friend Jana is missing 
since last night. Narendra went 
missing the night before. I mean, I 
don’t care about Narendra, but I 
care about Jana.. People are saying 
Stree took him.
(struggles)
Can I ask you something?
Gayatri is curious -- and suspicious.
VICKY
Don’t take it personally please. 
But I have to ask.. Are you.. Are 
you by any chance.. Stree??
(off of her angry stare)
I mean.. I just.. want to know. So 
I thought I’ll ask you. Even if you 
are, it’s ok.. I’ll just mentally 
prepare myself for it.. That’s all.
Gayatri is getting angrier.
VICKY
Please don’t get angry.. I am 
just.. Oh God!
Vicky is disturbed. Gayatri not reacting is making him more 
unnerved.
He suddenly sees a guy cycling at a distance.
Instinctively he runs up to the guy.
VICKY
Oh helloo... one second..
That guy stops.
VICKY
(hushed tone)
Brother, just tell me something. Do 
you see that girl sitting there?
(pointing in Gayatri’s 
direction)
That guy looks for a long moment in that direction. Then--
BIKE GUY
Which girl?
Vicky sharply turns his head to look at Gayatri. 
But she’s not there!67."
"68.What the actual fuck!
BANG CUT TO:
TEESRI RAAT
TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT
A lot of people have gathered and there’s a lot of excitement 
in the air. 
Led by Narendra’s friends, a vigil is forming, with mashaals 
and everything. 
Narendra’s friends are revving their bikes to add to the 
energy of the scene. The leader of the gang, Durga Prasad, is 
yelling out instructions.
DURGA
(yells out)
We are going to go through each 
lane of the town and look for that 
Stree!
Everyone agrees.
DURGA
But We need a slogan. We can’t just 
walk around quietly. We need a 
couple of slogans.
FRIEND
Oh! (scratches his head)
Friend 1 spots Vicky and Bittu a little far.
DURGA
Hey! We are trying to rescue your 
friend too. So you better join and 
get your families too.
BITTU
Yeah yeah.. Of course.
VICKY
So what’s the plan exactly?
DURGA
Well, we will go around shouting 
out for Stree. 
VICKY
And if she does show up? Then what?
Beat.68."
"69.DURGA
Behenchod.. we will figure 
something on the way. Chalo!
ANOTHER STREET
The crowd passes through, waving mashaals and chanting.
CROWD
Kal nahi parson nahi.. O stree 
kabhi nahi.. Aana nahi aana nahi..
At the end of the crowd, Vicky and Bittu are reluctantly 
walking and shouting along most unenthusiastically. 
Then --
VICKY
This shit is useless. We need to 
find out more about Stree. Who she 
is, what she wants.
BITTU
You didn’t ask your girlfriend?
VICKY
(glares at him)
We need to talk to someone who 
knows this shit!
Beat.
BITTU
I know exactly the guy.
RUDRA’S BOOKSTORE
It’s an old bookstore-cum-lending library. Random paperbacks 
and magazines line the shelves in the cramped room.
Rudra leads them through a narrow corridor --
RUDRA
Nobody knows shit. 
BITTU
Except you!
RUDRA
Except me! 
And they enter -- 
BACKROOM - CONTINUOUS
Shelves line the walls, filled with dusty old books.69."
"70.RUDRA
Now I have been doing some research 
of my own. And I found something 
very interesting.
Rudra pulls out an old, crumbling, cheap book.
RUDRA
This town ka puraan!
VICKY
This town has a puraan also?!
RUDRA
Yeah. Written by Shankar Shastri.
-- Rudra flips through the book --
VICKY
That senile old writer who used to 
live by the creek?
Rudra stares Vicky down.
RUDRA
Before he lost his marbles, he was 
a vidhwan.
Vicky nods.
Rudra sifts through the book -- filled with sketches along 
with prose. 
SHOTS OF the corresponding sketches as he reads in a sing 
song tone --
RUDRA
“Many years ago.. blah blah blah.. 
a beautiful prostitute decided to 
marry her lover.. blah blah.. Whole 
town was furious and jealous at 
this decision..” 
Yeah, sure!
“they banished her and decided to 
punished her and treated her like 
she was a witch..” 
Oh God.. these humans! Such brutal 
creatures! 
“She loved him with all her heart.. 
Blah blah.. And married him against 
all resistance.” 
Way to go girl!
“But in a tragic turn of events, 
the people of the town hunted her 
down..” 
Bloody bastards.. 70."
"71.“And before they could consummate 
their union..” 
That’s so sad! They didn’t even 
make love! 
“They cut off the head of her 
husband..” 
Bastards! Bloody animals!! 
“Ever since she roams the area.. 
Blah blah.. looking for her lost 
love.. blah blah.. And to 
consummate their love..” 
That is so sad..
VICKY
Rudra-bhai.. If you don’t mind, 
will you please stop your side 
commentary and read ahead to the 
solution part.
RUDRA
Fine.. Ok here it is! “The only way 
the town can find mukti from her 
is..
(flips to next page)
-- looks at the two, nodding excitedly, at the suspense --
RUDRA
“the main occupation of the town 
used to be paddy and the main 
caste..” What!??
He turns the pages back and forth and realizes --
RUDRA
What the hell is the senile old 
fool rambling about?
Vicky snatches the book from him and checks it.
VICKY
It jumps from page 66 to page 73. 
It’s missing pages!
RUDRA
(miffed)
That’s why I don’t let anyone in 
this room! Nobody respects books 
these days! Ungrateful kids, 
tearing pages from my books. 
Beat.
BITTU
Shit! What do we do now?
VICKY
Do you have any idea where she 
comes from, where we can find her? 71."
"72.She must be resting somewhere in 
between?!
Rudra shrugs.
Vicky flips a couple of pages back. FOCUS ON an illustration 
depicting a bride and a headless groom.
VICKY
I think I have seen this somewhere.
RUDRA
(thinks)
I know that place!
Vicky and Bittu look at him, like - ‘Yes?’
RUDRA
(beat)
You want to go there?
(off of Vicky’s nod)
Now?
(off of another nod)
Like now now??
Vicky stares at him, like - ‘Of course!’
EXT. STREETS - NIGHT
Vicky, Bittu, Rudra go triples on Rudra’s scooter. 
As they cross one of the lanes, they see the vigil crowd 
pass. It has substantially dwindled and the energy is halved.
CROWD
Sona nahi chandi nahi.. humara dost 
lauta abhi! 
The three are glad they are not part of that moronic bunch.
BITTU
What shit are they saying!
RUDRA
This is the problem of today’s 
youth. Lack of education.
They drive away.
EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
The three arrive at the edge of some woods. They park their 
bike and start walking inside.
They soon arrive at --
The ruins of what was a temple a few hundred years ago. 
Basking in the moonlight. Eerily unwelcoming.72."
"73.They look around at the scary surroundings -- conscious of 
the hair-rising atmosphere that has engulfed the whole place 
now.
BITTU
You sure we should go in now?
RUDRA
We could come back tomorrow during 
the day. I think that’d be better..
VICKY
Come on, guys. If Jana is in there 
somewhere we have to find him 
tonight. Tomorrow will be too late.
And starts walking. Reluctantly Rudra and Bittu follow.
RUINS
Monstrous cobwebs run from wall to wall, amidst scarred and 
deformed figures of local deities. A strange energy field can 
be felt at certain spots of the temple. It’s a scary place. 
They come to a place that appears to have many pronged 
corridors staring back at them.
Vicky silently signals to Bittu ‘you go that way’ and to 
Rudra ‘you go this way’ and ‘I’ll go this way.’
Bittu signals back energetically: ‘what?!! Why the fuck are 
we splitting up?’
Not really acknowledging him, Vicky and Rudra go two separate 
ways. Bittu stands there undecided which way to go. Heads in 
Vicky’s direction, changes his mind, heads towards Rudra. 
Except he can’t see him any more. Panicky he turns -- and 
can’t see Vicky either!
Shit!
He heads inside, shitting bricks.
VICKY
Vicky follows the weird and sometimes grotesque wall 
carvings, shining his tiny flashlight.  
He starts going through what soon turns into a maze of 
passages. 
A scare. As a bevy of bats noisily leave their perch and fly 
past him -- almost knocking him off.
He recovers. Moves on.
He arrives at a junction, but has no clue which way he came 
in from. 73."
"74.Prods on.
And arrives at the same scary sculpture. 
WTF!
Now he is thoroughly lost.
BITTU
Bittu is scared out of his wits. Slowly prods on.
A scare. BAM! As a shadowy figure goes past!
Bittu falls, scrambles, curses. This causes a few stones come 
rolling down from the ceiling and walls.
Bittu crawls on all fours out of that area.
He’s on the verge of tears now.
BITTU
(softly)
Vicky.. Rudra..
A scare. As the shadowy figure passes again!
Bittu loses it. He begins running -- to get the hell out of 
there.
Slips.
Falls.
Rolls.
Rubble falls on him.
Bats fly past him.
All these only make him scamper and run faster!
RUDRA
Rudra -- more excited than afraid -- walks through the narrow  
passages.
RUDRA
(softly)
Stree.. er.. Stree-ji.. Are you 
here?
He hears a rumble. He goes quiet. 
The rumble starts getting closer. He realizes it’s coming 
from a certain passage in the maze.
He picks up a rod/stone/log. Waits by the corner.74."
"75.The rumble -- kind of like laboured breathing -- starts 
getting close. 
Closer.
Very close.
Just feet away.
Right there.
And Rudra swings the weapon.
Catches the approaching figure bang in the middle of the 
torso. 
THUD!
Bittu doesn’t know what hit him! He flips in mid-air and 
falls hard on the ground.
Moans.
Rudra realizes it’s Bittu. Helps him up.
BITTU
(in pain)
What the hell is wrong with you?
RUDRA
What the hell is wrong with you? 
You’re running like you saw a 
ghost!
BITTU
(irony)
Right.
VICKY
Vicky arrives at a sculpture of the bride and headless groom. 
Same as the illustration in the book. 
Next to it, he notices a crevice in the wall, with a large 
block blocking it partly.
Strange wind and sounds seem to come from the crevice.
Should he dare to go in?
And then he hears!
HER VOICE 
(softly)
Vickyyy...
The hair on his neck stands up. He stands, frozen in place.
Behind him, barely visible, the shadowy figure of a woman in 
a red sari.75."
"76.VICKY
(mutters)
I’m not turning around.*
HER VOICE
Vickyyyyyy...
Shit! She’s close.
As she’s about to say it for the third time, he tries to 
overpower her voice by trying to talk over her, so she can’t 
be heard.
VICKY
No way! I will not turn around!.. 
Do what you want.. call however 
many time.. I am not turning! I can 
do this all day --
HER VOICE
Vickyyyyyy...
Fuck! It didn’t matter. He heard her call anyway!
WE SEE -- Stree! Literally off the ground by a foot or so, 
right behind Vicky -- so close that she’s whispering lovingly 
right into his ear!
Tension.
Vicky grits his teeth. It takes all his restraint and control 
to not turn around. He can literally feel her presence any 
more.
A long tense beat, as the music crescendos.
And it stops. As abruptly as it started. He doesn’t seem to 
feel her presence any more.
Vicky stands there. Has she left? 
Beat.
He reaches into his pocket -- pulls out his mobile -- brings 
it up to his face -- closes his eyes -- and clicks a selfie.
Click!
He looks at the picture. He is alone.
He heaves a sigh of relief and turns.
BAM!
There she is -- right in front of him.
The demure bride. Ghoonghat covering her eyes. Bright red 
lips visible under the edge of the ghoonghat.
Shocked witless, he is petrified.76."
"77.She slowly starts to lift her head. He finds himself staring 
back at her.
Intercut between the two, as they try to look at each other. 
Her POV and his POV. 
Anticipation. Tension. 
And finally we see her face! In the shadowy darkness. The 
outline of a pretty girl’s face.
And then, he looks directly into her eyes!
Soft, sweet eyes. Vicky’s expression mellows. And suddenly 
the face starts to turn ghostly and evil – Vicky is shocked 
and immobile out of fear. 
Stree starts to let out a scream -- pounces on him -- 
HER POV
-- and for one inexplicable moment stops -- tilts her head 
sideways -- like baffled, checking out --
Just a brief moment. Then --
Abruptly out of nowhere, an axe comes hurling -- cuts the air 
in between her and Vicky -- and lodges in the wall!
She and Vicky both look at the source.
It’s Gayatri! 
Carrying an entire cornucopia of weird stuff on her. She has 
come fully equipped. 
A bizarre fight sequence ensues --
Stree lets out an ear-exploding scream. But Gayatri holds her 
own. She starts hurling strange stuff at Stree -- also 
chanting weird mantras. 
A sort of energy field forms around them -- as opposing 
forces collide.
Vicky is knocked to the ground by this. 
He watches Gayatri take on Stree. Stree tries to dodge the 
holy powders that Gayatri is throwing at her. 
The sheer amount of smoke and dust and the energy field that 
has swamped the atmosphere makes visibility poor. It is hard 
for Vicky to see what is really going on. 
Stree’s face looks terrified as she works up a storm -- the 
place starts swirling like it’s caught in a typhoon -- 
Gayatri does something with her hands -- desperately trying 
to summon up some powers -- doesn’t look like she is 
succeeding --77."
"78.-- Stree rushes at her, takes a swipe, throwing Gayatri a few 
feet away -- and in a blinding flash, She vanishes. 
Beat.
Suddenly, silence. 
Is she gone?
VICKY
Oh my God Oh my God! What the hell 
was that! What just happened!?
He then rushes up to the fallen Gayatri -- weakened a little 
bit by the blow.
VICKY
Are you ok?
He helps her up.
GAYATRI
Are you ok?
VICKY
(nods, then)
Well.. I guess that proves you are 
not her.
GAYATRI
You want to go down that road 
again??
VICKY
Sorry.. I didn’t mean it..
(then)
Thanks.. You saved my life.
-- and goes for a hug. She doesn’t reciprocate. It turns into 
an awkward one way hug. 
Once he recovers from the hug, he looks around scarily.
VICKY
Have we.. is she.. finished?
-- Gayatri takes in the ghostly place --
GAYATRI
I don’t think so.
(beat)
She’ll be back.
OUTSIDE THE RUINS - NIGHT
Bittu is sitting on a rock -- trembling in fear -- all 
muddied from the fall. Rudra is pacing back and forth 
thinking hard. They hear footsteps.
Vicky emerges.78."
"79.Bittu gets up and runs to him, ready to hug --
BITTU
Oh my god Vicky! You’re safe! I 
thought--
-- sees Gayatri emerge from behind him --
BITTU
--eek! 
-- abruptly turns around and runs the other way --
BITTU
She has taken him hostage. Run!
VICKY
Bittu. Stop. Calm down.
Bittu stops -- in a combat pose -- stands there staring at 
Gayatri. Who is party baffled, partly irritated!
GAYATRI
He also thinks I am..?
VICKY
Bittu. Calm down. She’s not it. She 
saved my life.
Oh!
WOODS - A LITTLE LATER
They all slowly walk out, pushing Rudra’s scooter along -- 
VICKY
--you should have seen it.. The way 
she fought that -- that -- bhoot.. 
Straight out of a bhoot film.
-- starts explaining moving his arms energetically with 
actions as he can’t find words -- 
Rudra and Bittu listen in awe. 
RUDRA
How did you.. Where did you learn.. 
I mean.. Why are you..?
(can’t figure what 
question to frame)
They all look at Gayatri. She’s put in a spot.
GAYATRI
A few years ago someone close to me 
was taken by her. Since then I have 
been looking for him. 
Vicky reacts sympathetically.79."
"80.GAYATRI
I started learning whatever I can 
that can help me connect with him. 
And started teaching myself a lot 
of techniques to fight that woman.
BITTU
(mutters)
That explains all that black magic 
Billi-ka-baal stuff..
GAYATRI
I have made it my mission to see 
the end of her.
(gets reflective)
I tried really hard today to use 
whatever I knew.. but it wasn’t 
enough. I thought I could.. 
(gets passionate) 
Do more.. do something stronger to 
vanquish her!
They’re in awe again! They walk in silence, checking this 
cool girl. Then --
RUDRA
Umm.. Miss.. Miss-ji.. I have 
learnt some of this stuff myself 
from the secret books in my 
library. So if you need someone to 
help you.. please let me know..
BITTU
My dad owns the big ready-made shop 
in town. You should come by some 
time. We carry all kinds of latest 
ladies fashions and stylings. 
As they continue walking -- a rustle, as a figure moves in 
the shrubs. 
Brief momentary tension.
They turn around and look. Far from them, a figure emerges.
Vicky’s and Bittu’s eyes light up! OMG!
TOWN - NIGHT
The five of them amble into town.
VICKY
I am so happy we found you man!
BITTU
You’ve been naked since 2 days??
(beat)
Kuch hua kya? Uske saath.
Vicky shushes him.80."
"81.VICKY
What happened Jana? What exactly 
happened?
JANA
I don’t remember anything.
RUDRA
Unbelievable times we live in!
They turn a corner --
CROWD
Kal nahi parson nahi.. O stree 
kabhi nahi.. Aana nahi aana nahi.. 
-- a meagre crowd of very few people chanting weakly. They 
stop on seeing these people.
Beat.
EXT. JANA’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Vicky without shirt, Bittu without pants and the third guy 
dressed in their clothes, enter the house.
A loud shriek of happiness comes from inside the house.
CUT TO:
COURTYARD - MOMENTS LATER
Wrapped in blanket and sitting dazed, is Jana!
A size-able crowd has gathered -- excitement in the air -- 
everyone amazed and shocked at the return of Jana.
The mother is being over-dramatic and fussing over Jana -- 
giving him food and drink etc.
Vicky and Bittu are very happy their friend is back.
VICKY
What happened Jana? What exactly 
happened?
JANA
I don’t remember anything.
Dad stares at him suspiciously, passes the stare on to Bittu, 
who tries to evade.
Durga Prasad and co also around.
DURGA
Did you see Narendra on the way 
somewhere?81."
"82.Jana looks at him blankly.
TIME LAPSE:
JANA’S HOUSE, TERRACE - LATER THAT NIGHT
Jana is fast asleep. Next to him on another mattress is 
Bittu.
Quiet. Peaceful.
Hold.
SUDDENLY -- Jana opens his eyes. Stares right ahead. He looks 
scarily zoned out.
He gets up. Stands next to Bittu’s bed.
Stares at Bittu.
A long hold. As the MUSIC crescendos.
TOWN - MORNING
The town. Asleep. Quiet.
A STREET
A scream cuts through the silence. A mother has discovered 
her son is missing.
ANOTHER STREET
Another scream. A husband has gone missing.
YET ANOTHER STREET
Yet another scream. A man has gone missing.
TOWN
Chaos reigns over the town, as a lot of screams coming from 
various parts merge. 
STREET CORNER
Gayatri watches at a distance --
Groups of people have gathered outside a smattering of 
houses. Cries can be heard from inside.
Vicky runs up and joins Gayatri.82."
"83.VICKY
How could this happen? What do you 
think happened?
Gayatri looks at him -- points to the houses.
GAYATRI
The inscriptions on the walls..
SHOTS OF --
-- various houses. 
-- The inscription has been messily wiped out. Like somebody 
hastily went around town wiping major parts of the message. 
Rendering it useless.
GAYATRI
Someone wiped out the inscriptions!
EXT. ONE HOUSE
Gayatri touches the wall -- and comes off with some red --
GAYATRI
Blood.
VICKY
Oh!
Beat.
GAYATRI
Is there any street here that has 
CCTV camera?
VICKY
CCTV camera?! In our town?! Are you 
ma-- 
(remembers) 
Actually..
JANA’S TERRACE
Jana and Bittu both stare at Jana’s hands. They’re dirty -- 
and he palms are all scratched up and bloody
BITTU
Was it like this last night?
JANA
I don’t remember.
BITTU
Shit, we need to go to a doctor.83."
"84.EXT. BITTU’S READYMADE SHOP
A few CCTV cameras are out front pointed at the street, in a 
couple of angles.
CCTV ROOM
A screens plays the footage from a camera mounted outside. 
Vicky and Gayatri are watching it carefully.
CCTV FOOTAGE:
Playing in fast forward. Empty street. An occasional 
passerby. A stray dog.
At around 3 AM, a lone figure enters the street. Goes to the 
first wall. And starts wiping off.
GAYATRI
There!
The video plays at normal speed.
The figure in the frame rubs wall after wall, as Vicky and 
Gayatri stare, still unable to make out who it is.
Finally the guy comes close enough and turns this side.
VICKY
Pause.
Video pauses.
VICKY
Shit!
The figure in the video is Jana.
SHARE AUTO, OUTSKIRTS ROAD - DAY
A large share auto -- the kind of rickshaw that can squeeze 
in about six or seven people chugs along the road.
Jana’s hands are bandaged now. Bittu rambles on --
BITTU
Shit, what’s happening in this 
town! It’s weird that you came 
back.. And now two dozen people 
have gone overnight! 
Jana is not listening. He seems lost.
BITTU
That Stree has gone mental! And how 
come as soon as you came back, so 
many are missing??
(then)84."
"85.Do you remember anything?
(hushed)
Uske saath kuch hua kya? You know.. 
Friendship types.. Rumors are that 
she gives excellent --
-- and Bittu looks at Jana. Jana suddenly stares back at him. 
With deadly eyes. 
Bittu is a little scared --
BITTU
Jana.. Jana..
The PASSENGER ahead of him, looks at Jana --
PASSENGER
Hello..
-- and tries to touch Jana.
Jana grabs the guy -- and physically throws him out of the 
tempo. The guy goes flying out of the moving vehicle on to 
the road.
The Passengers are all scared now.
An intense quick skirmish ensues.
Bittu tries to stop Jana, but he is too strong -- Bittu is 
shoved to the back of the tempo.
Another passenger, seeing this, voluntarily jumps off the 
moving vehicle -- and rolls on the road.
Next is the driver -- Jana tries to grab the driver, the 
other passengers try to stop him. 
The driver loses control and the tempo veers off the road -- 
and crashes into a tree in a ditch.
Bittu is sent rolling into the ditch, along with others.
The momentum sends Jana crashing through the windshield -- he 
flies ahead and lands in the ditch.
And in a continuous move he stands up.
WTF!
Bittu is scared.
Jana looks listlessly at all the people around. And as 
suddenly as it all started, he comes out of the trance. His 
eye roll up, and he faints.
As soon as he hits the ground, Bittu runs to him and pins him 
down. Others come to help too -- all wounded.
But Jana is passed out.85."
"86.Hold on Bittu.
JANA’S HOUSE
Jana is on the bed -- both his hands tied to the bed post. 
He’s passed out. Bittu is sitting next to him, keeping a 
watchful eye on him.
VICKY
Looks like Jana is still her 
prisoner.
GAYATRI
(agrees)
The Stree has control over his 
mind.
BITTU
(mutters)
Makes sense why Stree didn’t finish 
up Jana and instead chose him to do 
the dirty work. Idiot can easily be 
manipulated.*
GAYATRI
We must get rid of Stree or else 
Jana will be her prisoner forever.
RUDRA
Tonight is the last night of puja. 
After this, she will vanish and not 
come back till next year.
VICKY
Whatever we do, we have to do it 
tonight. 
(beat)
So.
GAYATRI
So.
VICKY
The Stree expert is sitting here. 
(pointing to Rudra)
And that’s all he knows too.
(Rudra shrugs)
That one book that had stuff about 
Stree is missing pages! 
GAYATRI
(thinking)
Who else might know? 
RUDRA
More than me?!
GAYATRI
What about the author of the book?
Beat.86."
"87.VICKY
He’s a senile old man. 
RUDRA
He’s lost his marbles.
GAYATRI
He’s still around?
RUDRA
(hesitantly)
Well.. Kinda..*emergency
Jana stirs -- wakes up -- takes in the situation.
JANA
What happened here? Why am I tied 
up like this?
They all exchange looks.
WRITER’S HOUSE - DAY
A senile old man, SHANKAR SHASTRI, in desperate need of a 
shave and shower, with a perennially lost-in-thought 
expression is at the moment.. lost in thought. 
Almost frozen.
Across from him all 5 of them are crowded on a diwan. Staring 
at him expectantly.
Shastri. Still frozen. Deep in thought.
Vicky starts to say something, Rudra quietly shushes him. 
Then --
SHASTRI
Which book??
Everyone grunts out loudly like - ‘After all this??’
Rudra doesn’t give up.
RUDRA
We just now mentioned, sir. The 
town gaatha.
SHASTRI
Oh that one!
(beat)
I wrote it?
Vicky is restless.
RUDRA
Yes. Remember? You came to my store 
also.. Actually many times..87."
"88.SHASTRI
Oh yes. You were selling porn. I 
remember.
RUDRA
(little embarassed but-)
Yes yes! So your book.. We finally 
read it.. and it’s missing pages. 
We wondered if you have the 
original--
SHASTRI
What original.
-- looks around the house -- fairly sparse. Doesn’t look like 
there’s anything here.
SHASTRI
This is all I have now. Baaki sab 
gaya.. After Stree took me..
What!?? 
They all jump up with questions.
GAYATRI
Stree took you??
RUDRA
He remembers!
BITTU
How did you come back?
VICKY
Do you remember the prophecy.. as 
to who can save the town from 
Stree..
GAYATRI
..who can destroy Stree??
SHASTRI
Where have I seen you before?
VICKY
I doubt you have seen her.
SHASTRI
She reminds me of this beautiful 
girl I met in Meerut once. I think 
I married her.
RUDRA
You don’t remember your wife?
BITTU
Is he even talking sense?
Vicky stands up noisily.88."
"89.VICKY
This is a waste of time. We have to 
find another way.
SHASTRI
Why is this man so rude?? You come 
to my place and behave so rudely to 
me?
GAYATRI
(intervenes)
Very sorry sir. He’s a very rude, 
uncouth man.
Mock-chides Vicky, who goes sullen a bit.
GAYATRI
Please continue sir. 
Beat. Shastri is lost on thought. Snaps out of it.
SHASTRI
Oh hi! When did you all come here? 
Welcome. Would you like some chai?
All jaws drop.
OUTSIDE - MINUTES LATER
VICKY
The old man is no help.
GAYATRI
Do you have any other books?
RUDRA
I don’t know.. This I found with 
great difficulty--
A voice cuts through their conversation --
SHASTRI
The fate of the town lies in the 
hands of this one man, the saviour 
of the town. 
-- they all listen in rapt attention, as Shastri rattles from 
the doorway.
SHASTRI
A man who is the only son; A 
handsome man, dark like the clouds; 
Born under a banyan tree; Love in 
his eyes; An artist who brings joy 
to many. 
(beat)
And the son of a whore.
And Shastri promptly walks back inside muttering --89."
"90.SHASTRI
Tum logon ne uske saath aacha nahi 
kiya hai.. sabo leke jayegi! Saalo, 
maroge tum log.. Kisi ko nahi 
chodegi woh!
Hold on all of them.
JANA’S HOUSE, BEDROOM - DAY
Jana is still tied to the bed. He’s awake now, albeit a 
little sedate, listening to them speak.
VICKY
What does he even mean? Can we 
believe anything he says?
GAYATRI
He sounded focused enough when he 
said these lines. A rare moment of 
clarity.
RUDRA
I agree. It looked like he 
remembered what he wrote in those 
pages.
VICKY
Even if we assume what he said is 
true, where are we going to find 
the guy with all these 
qualifications now?
BITTU
Tough.
Beat. All a bit dejected.
Still tied to the bed, Jana pipes in, sounding like he’s now 
used to the position he’s in.
JANA
Vicky, weren’t you born at your 
Grandma’s village?
(off of Vicky’s nod)
It had that huge banyan tree behind 
their house, right?
VICKY
Oh yeah..
Everybody is curious now.
JANA
And you are an only son.
RUDRA
That’s two out of three 
requirements.90."
"91.GAYATRI
He’s also a handsome guy!
VICKY
(blushes)
Thank you.
BITTU
(mutters)
Yeah right!
JANA
And dark..
VICKY
(scoffs)
GAYATRI
And hey!
(everyone looks at her)
You are an artist!
BITTU
How the hell!?!
JANA
He creates the best ladies fashions 
across the three towns!
BITTU
Best blouses you mean?
GAYATRI
And look at the women rushing to 
you for their dresses.. for the art 
you created! You bring joy to them!
-- Bittu rolls his eyes further, Vicky blushes further --
VICKY
Well, if you say so. 
JANA
An artist who brings joy to people!
Beat.
VICKY
I must say it’s quite a 
coincidence.. that I match 4 out of 
5 requirements at least. But.. 
What’s the use.. 
The three guys look at each other. 
BITTU
(tentatively)
So.. We actually have a match??
Everyone’s almost elated at the discovery. Almost.91."
"92.VICKY
What about the last requirement?
Long beat. 
Vicky looks at them all. Then --
RUDRA
(tentatively)
Oh. You don’t know?
VICKY
I don’t know what??
JANA
(to Rudra, softly)
No one told him.
Everyone looks at each other.
RUDRA
You see Vicky.. there’s nothing 
wrong in doing a job-
VICKY
What the fuck are you guys saying??
RUDRA
About your mother.. Everyone in 
town knows..
BITTU
(gently)
Yeah..
Vicky is lost!
RUDRA
..that she was a.. Ahem..
VICKY
What the hell!?? How dare you guys 
talk shit about my mother?? What’s 
wrong with you people?
Gayatri doesn’t know what to say.
VICKY
It’s not funny. Don’t joke about 
these--
(sees they’re serious)
Are you all serious?!! How can you-- 
Screw you all!!
Seething with anger, he stares at them. They all look away.
QUIRKY SAD MUSIC starts --92."
"93.EXT. TOWN - EVENING
A disturbed Vicky walks alone through the streets -- as the 
townspeople get on with their daily grind.
The Watchman is busy rewriting the wiped out messages, with a 
few others helping him.
A sense of gloom has fallen over the town.
INT. TAILORING SHOP - EVENING
Vicky enters the shop -- sees his father alone on the sewing 
machine in a corner working his ass off on a dress. A large 
pile of dresses lie by his side.
Vicky ponders for a minute. He’s not looking forward to the 
awkward conversation about to ensue. Firming his resolve he 
walks up to him.
VICKY
Pa.
Dad, without looking up --
DAD
Dinner is set at home. Go eat. I 
will take a while. I have to finish 
this pile.
Vicky doesn’t move. He just stands there.
Dad looks up.
VICKY
Pa.. I wanted to ask you something.
DAD
Yes.
Beat. As Vicky hesitates. Dad waits.
Then --
VICKY
Do you need help.. with this pile..
DAD
No it’s ok. You go eat dinner. 
We’ll start early tomorrow.
Vicky nods and quietly leaves.
VICKY’S TERRACE - LATE EVENING
Vicky goes up to the terrace. Crestfallen.93."
"94.MOMENTS LATER
Gayatri comes up to the terrace.
Vicky acknowledges her but is not in a good mood obviously.
A moment later --
GAYATRI
I am sorry about your mother..
VICKY
Why are you sorry? It’s not your 
fault that she’s--
(beat)
Now that I think about it each time 
my father told me stories about my 
mother, it was always a little 
different. Something was different 
each time. I should’ve guessed then 
only that something was fishy.
She nods sympathetically.
GAYATRI
You talked to your father?
VICKY
(shakes his head)
What’s the point? He is working day 
and night to put food on the table. 
He hasn’t wanted anything except a 
good life for me. What’s the point 
of raking up something that 
happened decades ago?
GAYATRI
It’s ok. It’s all in the past. It 
doesn’t matter.
(adds)
Plus I think your father must’ve 
been cool. And way ahead of his 
time.
Vicky stares at her like - ‘it’s not helping.’
GAYATRI
I am just trying to cheer you up.
Gayatri feels sorry for him, takes his hand in hers. Vicky is 
conscious of her hand touching his.
GAYATRI
You have a good heart. And I’d 
happy to do friendship with you.
Vicky’s heart skips a beat. Then --
VICKY
Oh you mean, you want to be my 
friend?94."
"95.GAYATRI
(puzzled)
Yeah.. 
VICKY
Ok. But please don’t use that word 
friendship around people here. 
GAYATRI
Friendship? Why not?
VICKY
Please.. Just.. Don’t.
A quiet moment.
GAYATRI
Whatever the prophecy might be one 
thing I saw that was unbelievable!
(Vicky’s curious)
You saw directly into her eyes! And 
you are still here. No one who has 
ever looked at her eyes has been 
left behind!
(beat)
There is something about you for 
sure. Maybe you are the one!
(adds)
You must face your destiny, Vicky.
VICKY
What destiny? My destiny is to get 
the hell out of this godforsaken 
town! 
Gayatri looks at him --
GAYATRI
This town has been nothing but good 
to you. Everyone in this town has 
known about your past, and yet they 
sheltered you from it. Nobody 
ridiculed you, or even revealed the 
truth to you.
Slowly Vicky nods -- as he sees the point.
He turns around to see Bittu and Rudra have also come up. And 
Jana. Vicky looks curiously at Bittu.
BITTU
It’s ok. He’s under control.. for 
now. 
Then to Vicky --
JANA
Sorry yaar..
BITTU
..about your mother.95."
"96.JANA
Everyone knew. But they just didn’t 
want you to feel any lesser. So..
Long beat. 
Vicky looks at everyone and takes a moment. Everyone looks at 
him expectantly.
Vicky walks up to them and gets a bit reflective --
VICKY
I guess I do owe this town one.
(starts getting emo)
And if I am the chosen one, so be 
it!
(adds)
This town did give me a great 
childhood and youth.. And protected 
me. And I am going to save all 
those poor bastards who were 
nabbed. And above all, I am going 
to save our friend Jana!
(beat)
If I am the one, then I am bloody 
well am going to fight Stree! 
(beat)
This is my fucking town!
They are all happy!
RUDRA
You are the chosen one, all right!
BITTU
The savior!
RUDRA
(claps in joy)
Yes! The proud son of a whore.
Face palm.
ENERGETIC MUSIC starts --
RUDRA'S LIBRARY
Everyone’s assembled there. Including Jana, whose hands are 
tied up, of course.
VICKY
What do we know? And what have we 
learnt? About Stree?
They all think for a brief second --
RUDRA
Well.. She is scary and --96."
"97.VICKY
She can read!
(off of their reaction)
Which bloody ghost-ghoul-spirit- 
demon can read??
True. Everyone nods.
RUDRA
True. We are dealing with an 
modern, educated woman here. 
Vicky is not really listening, but talking.
VICKY
No 2. She can follow instructions. 
She’s haunting this town and she 
wants to pick up a guy and then 
she’s reading ‘O Stree Kal Aaana’. 
And she’s like ‘Oh ok no problem, I 
will come and check on you 
tomorrow’ and goes away!
Makes sense.
VICKY
And No 3. She’s being quite dumb, 
no? Think about it. Every night 
she’s coming and seeing the same 
inscription written from last time 
and she’s like ‘Oh no, they wrote 
it again! They wrote it today also! 
Now I can’t go in again!!’ But 
doesn’t realize that we are messing 
with her by keeping the same 
inscription every day, every year!
Everybody nods. Except Gayatri, who’s a tad more serious.
RUDRA
Her IQ seems to be quite low I must 
say.
VICKY
Well, my friends, we are definitely 
smarter than her. And I am sure we  
can see the end of her.. Send her 
back to where she came from!
Everybody is charged up.
ENERGETIC MUSIC starts --
TOWN - VARIOUS SPOTS - LATE EVENING
The final and most important night of puja now. But there 
seems to be a gloom that has set in over the town.
The town is buzzing in festive colours and decorations, but 
the people don’t seem to be happy. 97."
"98.More importantly it is only women on the street. Not a single 
man. They’ve all shut themselves in. Unless you count the 
handful of men dressed up as women to be part of the puja 
ritual.
OLD OUTHOUSE NEAR THE RUINS
Vicky, Bittu, Rudra and Gayatri are doing their prep at the 
lone spot.
-- Bunch of stuff is spread around the area. Gayatri is 
prepping with that stuff. 
-- She’s busy fashioning some weapons, tying sacred threads 
around them, and smearing them with holy powders.
-- Rudra is concocting strange mixtures in containers. Bittu 
is heling him - eggs, bhasm, sindoor etc.
-- Gayatri is also going over strange mantras. 
-- The boys start to make the bed for Vicky’s suhaag rat.
-- They start writing something on the wall. 
-- Putting candles all around.
-- They start helping Vicky get ready.
Finally we see what the prep was about. 
-- Vicky is dressed like a groom! 
-- And on the front wall of the old outhouse is written a 
message, large and clear: O Stree, Aana.
INT. OUTHOUSE- NIGHT
On Vicky. Dressed like a groom. Sitting and biting his nails 
nervously. Place is lit up with candles.
-- Rudra gets a box of sindoor and offers it to Vicky.
-- Bittu gives him a packet of condoms. Just in case!
Rudra hands over a kajal dibbi to Gayatri who tries to put a 
kajal mark on his cheek. Vicky resists.
VICKY
(little irritated)
Is this level of detailing 
necessary?
Gayatri backs off.
VICKY
That bloody Shastri better be 
right! Or I am literally screwed!98."
"99.RUDRA
Think about it.. it’s your destiny! 
You are getting a great opportunity 
to save this town! You’re the 
chosen one. The saviour. The son of 
a--
BITTU
Yes.. think about the fact that you 
are doing a great service to the 
town!
(off of his reaction)
And why are you turning into a 
pussy when earlier you roared like 
a lion! Be a man!
VICKY
(stressed)
Bittu.. Phakyu!
Vicky is getting pretty nervous. 
VICKY
What is the plan exactly! Tell me 
again. 
Gayatri lowers herself in front of him. And holds his hand.
GAYATRI
Vicky listen. Stree will come for 
you. We have made sure of that. And 
when she looks into your eyes, you 
look back. And I have a mantr that 
will bound her and.. (little 
unsurely) probably finish her.
BITTU
(looking at his watch)
Let’s go. It’s time!
As Gayatri gets ready to go and hide, Vicky doesn’t let get 
go of her hand. He pulls her back.
VICKY
Will your plan work?
Beat.
She nods her head. But it’s not a very confident nod.
GAYATRI
90%.
VICKY
90?? 
GAYATRI
99.. I guess.
VICKY
So there’s a 1% chance that I’ll 
be.. (gestures)99."
"100.Gayatri puts her hand on his shoulder.
GAYATRI
I’ll be right behind you. I will 
fight stree. I will not let 
anything happen to you.
BITTU
We will be hiding nearby. We got 
your back, bro.
Gayatri shows the stuff she’s armed with -- a bunch of 
weaponry and kaala jaadu stuff. 
And hands him a dagger. 
VICKY
What’s this for??
GAYATRI
When the time comes-
BITTU
We have to go!! Let’s go!
(to Vicky)
Don’t worry. Be like a Rajput!
They all head out, leaving Vicky behind.
Vicky calms down. Takes a deep breath --
VICKY
(poignantly)
If I don’t come back, don’t come 
looking for me.
Beat.
BITTU
Sure. That’s common sense. 
Vicky stares at him.
RUDRA
Be positive!
AAKHRI RAAT
EXT. RUINS - NIGHT
Eerie. Quiet. Just the howl of the wind.
And then --100."
"101.HER POV
She emerges from the temple. And gently glides through the 
woods.
Tension builds.
She sees a flickering light in the near distance. She glides 
closer to it.
A signboard with a thick arrow points to the light - ’This 
Way’.
She heads to the light. Which is coming from the outhouse.
JANA’S HOUSE
Suddenly Jana wakes up. Still tied to the bed, he starts 
convulsing. Staring straight ahead. Possessed.
INNER ROOM IN THE OUTHOUSE
Bittu, Rudra and Gayatri -- fully armed -- wait in a dark 
corner of the house. They hear a faint rustle.
BITTU
(shit scared)
I think it’s her.
Gayatri peeks out. Sees a shadowy figure in the darkness in 
the shrubbery outside.
Turns to them and puts her finger to her lips.
Fucking tense.
JANA’S HOUSE
Jana is calm. His mother is feeding him food.
JANA
Ma.. My hands are hurting, ma! Can 
you please untie me.
She is unsure.
JANA
Please, ma. I am fine now. See..
HALL
Vicky is sitting, dressed up like a groom, on the bed. Rather 
stoic. Like he’s totally given up.101."
"102.OUTSIDE - HER POV
She glides to the entryway. 
More arrows point to the entrance. 
A big sign reads - ‘O Stree, Aana’ welcomes her.
She tilts her head for a moment as she ponders.
Long beat.
She then goes around the house.
INNER ROOM
They are surprised.
GAYATRI
She is not entering!
BITTU
Does she suspect something?
RUDRA
I guess she’s not as obedient as we 
thought!
(in awe)
Too good too good!
(adds)
Never understimtate Stree!
BITTU
Whose side are you on?!
OUTSIDE - HER POV
She goes through the overgrown wild shrubbery, around the 
outhouse. 
INNER ROOM
Gayatri anxiously keeps peeking out to see any movement -- 
focused on the outside.
OUTSIDE - HER POV
She is checking out the house from all directions! And then 
she focuses on one room. 
Inside that room is Vicky.
She takes a moment, and rushes towards that room. 
ABRUPT CUT TO:102."
"103.HALL
Vicky. Waiting. Anxious. 
He hears a rustle. His antennae perk up. candles are blown 
off.
He gets up and slowly goes to the back room like possessed 
man. The same doorway where Stree just rushed in through.
MUSIC begins to crescendo. He reaches the back room -- 
holding his breath -- cautiously peeks outside. 
MUSIC stops.
INNER ROOM
They are focussed on the main door. 
GAYATRI
I don’t think she will come through  
there!
BITTU
But what if --
(almost shrieks)
Standing right there is Jana. Looking completely 
expressionless.
BITTU
Jana.. How did you..?
Beat.
Suddenly Jana grabs Bittu and throws him against the wall.
Jana is back to being super strong again. Gayatri and Rudra 
jump in and try to subdue him.
A skirmish ensues.
BACK ROOM
Vicky looks around the back room. There are no doors or 
windows. And there’s no one there.
He is a tad relieved. He turns, and --
BAM!
There she is. In his room. 
Vicky stumbles and falls backwards in fear.
INNER ROOM
Suddenly Gayatri hears Vicky’s scream.103."
"104.Gayatri throws a rope, she had carried along with other 
stuff, to Bittu. 
GAYATRI
(to Bittu)
Stay with him.
BITTU
Me?
(adds)
Shit! 
Bittu and Rudra together try to manage Jana as Gayatri runs 
out of there.
BACK ROOM
Gayatri runs through the passages and towards the back room. 
She reaches the room -- sees it’s empty. Her heart drops.
Very soon Bittu and Rudra catch up to her in the back room.
GAYATRI
He’s not there!
BITTU
Where did he go!? But there’s only 
one entrance to this place.
RUDRA
Streeji has come. And she has taken 
away her man.
Gayatri spots something. She goes to the wall and finds a -- 
hidden passage!
BITTU
Shit!
All three peer into the dark deep passage.
RUDRA
Stree is smarter than all the men! 
She fooled all of us!
BITTU
Will you stop praising her! Where 
the hell did she take Vicky!??
GAYATRI
(beat)
I think I know where. 
They hear Jana yelling.
JANA (O.S.)
Hello! Bittu!! Come here..
Bittu shakes his head to them, like ignore him.104."
"105.JANA (O.S.)
Come here. I have to tell you 
something.
INNER ROOM
Bittu goes up to Jana.
JANA
I am fine! Take me with you.
BITTU
No! You stay put here. We’ll be 
back.
JANA
What do you mean? You can’t leave 
me here!
BITTU
I can’t keep up with your mood 
swings, Jana! Stay right here for a 
few minutes and we’ll be back.
JANA
No no no no.. Don’t leave me alone 
here!
Suddenly Jana turns ‘on’. He growls and screams.
They all turn to see him. 
BITTU
I knew it.
(to the others)
Let’s go. Let him keep growling.
And they get out of there.
Jana goes ‘off’ again.
JANA
(yells)
Bittu, fucker! Take me with you. Or 
at least untie me! What if she 
comes back for me?
As they walk away --
BITTU
(yells back)
I don’t think so. I think she’s had 
her fill of you. 
JANA
What if she comes back for 
seconds??
-- but they’re gone.105."
"106.PASSAGE
It’s pitch black. We can’t see anything. Sounds of Vicky’s 
screams and sounds off falling. 
We then hear frantic breathing of a trapped man. 
Vicky turns on the phone, looks around, shitting bricks. 
Visibility is poor. 
He turns all around to see where he is. 
He pulls out his phone and looks around. 
He then gets an idea. Quickly he grapples with the phone to 
text.
He then enters a cellar.
EXT. OUTHOUSE - NIGHT
Gayatri, Rurda and Bittu take a moment outside the spooky 
structure. 
Gayatri then starts prepping.
GAYATRI
I am going in.
BITTU
Really?
Before they can react, she jumps into it and disappears.
Long beat. As the two stare into the passage in shock. Then --
BITTU
We should also go no?
RUDRA
I guess so.
Beat.
RUDRA
But she looks like an expert.
BITTU
That’s also true.
Beat.
RUDRA
Maybe we just wait here and make 
sure they come back safe.
BITTU
Plus Jana is also here alone. 106."
"107.BITTU
Sahi hai.
CELLAR
Vicky looks around the strange place. Walks ahead -- looks 
around and suddenly sees --
Stree standing at a distance, near the water body -- making 
growling noises. 
Startled, Vicky stumbles back and falls onto a stone bed. The 
growling stops.
He recovers and looks at Stree but she’s not there. He slowly 
gets up to look around. The growling restarts. He jumps back 
onto the stone and the growling stops.
He tries again to get off the plank, and the growling 
restarts -- this time louder. He jumps back on to the stone.
Long beat.
Vicky then realizes and looks at the stone, which 
suspiciously looks like a rocky bed.
He looks around. There are no noises now.
Vicky suddenly realizes.
VICKY
(mumbles)
Oh phuck!
He knows what he has to do. He takes a deep breath, and 
announces --
VICKY
(trembling voice)
Main ready hoon.
He pats on the bed. Like he’s calling her over to sit next to 
him. 
Growling starts. From the darkess, two glowing eyes appear. 
Vicky swallows hard. 
The eyes keep watching but she doesn’t come over.
He tries a couple of ways of calling her over in sign-
language. 
VICKY
(tentatively)
Stree-ji.. Stree-madam.. 
(clears his throat)
O Stree.. Aaana..
No movement from her. But the growling increases.107."
"108.Vicky closes his eyes like -- Shit, I will have to do this!
Vicky takes his turban and puts it down. And looks at her. 
Growling increases.
He quickly takes off his kurta and stands there, a bit shy. 
Still no movement. 
He decides to remove other accessories.
Growling is not reducing.
He finally resigns to the whole thing. Fuck it. And takes off 
his pants.
As soon as the pants drop --
Stree suddenly lets out an angry growl. Rushes towards him 
and before he can realizes, and knocks him over, like she’s 
slapped him hard.
And disappears into darkness.
The growling is crazy now and is echoing from all directions.
Vicky recovers and starts screaming apologies --
VICKY
Sorry sorry! I misread your 
signals!! So sorry!! 
(scrambles for clothes)
See see.. I am wearing my clothes 
back. Those bastards.. my bastard 
friends told you wanted suhaag 
raat.. So sorry! See.. See.. I am 
pulling up my pants!
He quickly pulls up his pants. 
The growling reduces a bit.
And suddenly he can see her slowly emerge from the darkness. 
She’s calmer but the low growls continue.
Slowly she starts coming towards Vicky. Vicky is transfixed. 
She comes and stands in front of him and looks into Vicky’s 
eyes. Vicky stares back into her. 
A moment.
Suddenly loud chants break the silence.
CONTINUOUS
Stree and Vicky both turn to see -- Gayatri shouting out a 
strange mantra. 
Before Stree can react, Gayatri throws a big puff of powder. 
The throw seems so powerful that Stree is sent flying! 108."
"109.She hits a wall and slumps down.
Vicky is amazed and shocked at the intervention.
Vicky and Gayatri rush to each other. 
VICKY
Oh my God! Wow! Is she dead??
(adds)
Thank you!
GAYATRI
I don’t think so. But she is under 
a bind. Quick come. We have to 
finish her.
Vicky scrambles up. Gayatri looks at him.
GAYATRI
Why the hell are you naked??
VICKY
Oh.. Sorry.
He’s embarassed and quickly puts on his kurta.
VICKY
I.. I was getting ready to take one 
for the village. And..
GAYATRI
Oh God, you were trying to sleep 
with her!?
VICKY
Well.. That’s what Rudra deduced 
she wanted!
GAYATRI
You men!
VICKY
What men! I wasn’t doing this for 
pleasure.. I was ready to die! 
Isn’t that what she’s supposed to 
do after sambhog? Devour the 
victim?
Gayatri shakes her head. Pulls out a dagger from her bag. It 
looks sanctified.
GAYATRI
We have to drive this into her 
heart to finish her.
VICKY
What!?
GAYATRI
You have to do it. You are the 
chosen one. 109."
"110.VICKY
No no no..
They both go up to the fallen Stree. Look at her. She looks 
like a regular woman who’s slumped on the floor. 
Gayatri gives him the dagger. And gestures what he has to do.
Vicky gets ready. Looks at Gayatri and then looks at Stree.
GAYATRI
This is exactly what the town did 
back then to her.
Vicky stops. Looks at her.
VICKY
So we are doing the same thing to 
her again? We are again giving her 
the same treatment?
Long beat. They look at the motionless Stree.
VICKY
Chhod dete hai kya?
Gayatri is also having second thoughts. 
Suddenly Stree comes to life and stands up in full force 
throwing them both off. The dagger goes flying.
Stree goes after Vicky and Gayatri rushes towards where the 
dagger flew.
Vicky braces for Stree attack. Gayatri yells out to him.
GAYATRI
Look her in the eye! Look her in 
the eye.
Stree comes to Vicky’s face. Vicky musters courage and flings 
the veil open revealing her deadly eyes.
She screams. He screams.
GAYATRI
Look her in the eye and you can 
hold her at bay!
He looks her in the eye with great difficulty. Stree 
continues to scream and threaten. 
VICKY
I don’t think this is working!
GAYATRI
It is working. Show her love in 
your eyes. Just show her a lot of 
love.
Vicky struggles to show love in his eyes.110."
"111.GAYATRI
Just keep doing what you are doing. 
Show more love! Come on! More 
pyaar!!
VICKY
Are you kidding me!? I am shitting 
bricks here.. And you want me to 
show love!?
Gayatri frantically looks for the dagger.
Vicky meanwhile is trying his best to show love in his eyes. 
It’s damn hard task. He tries his best. And to us, it is 
hilarious!
Gayatri spots the dagger but it’s stuck somwhere hard to 
reach. 
VICKY
How long do I have to do this??? 
Plan kya hai??
GAYATRI
I have to somehow cut her choti.. 
VICKY
Choti??
Gayatri struggles for the dagger.
GAYATRI
I cannot reach the dagger!
Vicky takes his eyes off Stree for just a second. 
VICKY
What!??
Stree tries to lunge. Vicky quickly turns back and looks into 
her eyes and tries to show lot of love. 
GAYATRI
Just hold her off for a few more 
seconds..
The moment builds up as Stree continues to scream.
Vicky has had enough. 
VICKY
Stop it! What is this you are 
doing!! Not everyone you are taking 
is a bad guy! You are being a bad 
person by doing this shit to this 
sweet town!
(yells louder)
I am the chosen one and I demand 
you stop this nonsense. Stop it!
She stops.111."
"112.Vicky lowers his voice.
VICKY
Sorry yaar.. I am apologizing 
nicely.. from me, from the entire 
village.. 
Stree has become quiet now. Vicky is elated. He turns to look 
at Gayatri!
GAYATRI
No!! Don’t look away!
Stree lunges at Vicky. He falls down backwards. 
GAYATRI
Run!!
Vicky scrambles and runs. 
Gayatri throws more mixture at Stree. But she’s only stopped 
for a moment this time. 
Stree starts chasing Gayatri. 
A chase ensues.
SHOT OF -- dagger being picked up.
And then Gayatri hits a dead end. 
She turns back to look at Stree. 
Stree is rushing towards her in a glorious fury. Her 
ghoonghat has come off exposing a scarier face.
Gayatri braces for the final onslaught.
Stree, in her most ferocious form, lunges towards her.
Gayatri shuts his eyes.
A huge roar and monstrous screams are heard. Loud noises 
follow. 
And then --
All quite. Gayatri opens his eyes. 
There is no Stree. Vicky stands there with Stree’s ponytail 
in her hand. 
The whole place is smoldering with dust and smoke.
Long beat.
They look at each other - has she gone?112."
"113.EXT. FACADE - NIGHT
Bittu is untying Jana’s hands. 
BITTU
So you had a chance and you didn’t 
take it??
(off of their look)
Which means she will again be back 
next year!? And start hunting 
again??
Beat. Gayatri and Vicky look at each other. 
GAYATRI
I think the one thing the town 
never gave her..
VICKY
Was respect! Which the town never 
gave her. And we were about to do 
the same!
GAYATRI
If the town can only give her the 
respect that she never had.. then 
maybe--
A rustle in the shrubs. They stop and turn around. 
More rustles. It’s coming from all around them.
A few feet emerge from the ruins. 
Their faces light up.
EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
The five weary warriors walk back victorious. Following them 
are a bunch of disoriented men. All naked. Almost like a walk 
of shame.
FADE OUT:
EXT. TOWN CENTRE - DAY
All rescued men are sitting on the stage, dressed in new 
clothes -- sponsored by Bittu’s readymade shop -- as 
displayed on the banners.
Vicky and friends are in a special row of seats. 
MLA
This... is a.. historic day for us. 
A historic day.. for our town. A 
historic day.. for our district. A 
historic day.. for our great state. 
A historic day for.. 113."
"114.(beat)
A historic day.
Everyone cheers. 
MLA
I am a man of my.. word. I 
declared.. that I would.. from my 
own pocket.. award those who will 
get our... young men back. And I.. 
intend to keep.. my promise!
(claps)
For every young man.. returned.. I 
promised.. 10,000 rupees. 
(claps)
For thirteen people returned, that 
is one lakh thirty thousand 
rupees.. To Vicky!
Bittu whispers to Vicky --
BITTU
He promised some 10 lakhs to 
whoever finishes Stree no?
JANA
Doubt we are getting that!
Vicky goes up to collect the check.
Vicky’s Dad is in full costume. He claps proudly and loudly. 
People around him pat him and nod at him with respect. He is 
beaming, points them towards his son. They all nod in 
respect.
MLA
Ladies and gentleman, let’s get to 
the main reason we have all 
gathered today. To celebrate the 
victory of this town and to honour 
the youth who has brought this 
victoy. Come let’s unveil.
Secretary nods at a local band on standby. And they jump 
start fanfare music. 
MLA goes near the chowk. And unveils the cornerstone amidst 
cheers. The inscription of course is more prominent in its 
proclmation about the MLA than the actual matter --
Son Of The Town
Vikramarthanda Narayan Borkakoty Vimuhale
And friends. 
Everyone cheers. Vicky proudly smiles -- at first, until --
BITTU
Vi-kra-maa-aarthaa.. Narayana.. 
Borka..
(gives up)
Yeh kaun hai?114."
"115.Vicky’s face drops. He leans towards the MLA --
VICKY
(low tone)
Sir, I had put in a request with 
your secretary to just spell my 
name as Vicky. They put the full 
length name!
(off of his reaction)
Sir nobody knows that name. They 
won’t know it’s me!
MLA pats the shoulder of a disappointed Vicky --
MLA
Look at your dad. 
The father is super proud. Tears run down his cheek. 
MLA
Your name, my son.. has the name of 
your father and the town! 
(off of Vicky’s look)
Be proud of it!
And pats him even more vigorously, almost shaking up Vicky 
out of the dispiritedness. 
Vicky gets it. And grins with pride.
Bittu meanwhile is whining to Jana --
BITTU
Friends?? They didn’t put our 
names! They just said friends!??
The band takes off to a higher note.
MOMENTS LATER
Vicky looks beyond the crowd, and sees --
Gayatri. She smiles at him.
He slowly heads towards her, as the proceedings continue in 
the backdrop.
MLA
And now we unveil the statue of the 
protector of the town.
He goes near a covered statue and starts to unveil it.
Just as the covers comes off the statue, Vicky turns a 
corner.
CONTINUOUS
Nobody. No Gayatri. 115."
"116.He stand there -- looks around for her.
A flutter.
His eye catches a letter, with a stone on it, flttering in 
the wind.
He picks up and reads --
GAYATRI (V.O.)
‘Dear Vicky, I am glad I met you. 
And have known you for a full four 
days. I wish I can stay back to do 
friendship with you.’
Vicky’s eyes light up for a moment.
GAYATRI (V.O.)
(beat)
I am glad you have realized the 
purpose of your life. You always 
knew you were meant for greater 
things, and now you have fulfilled 
your destiny. I am happy I could be 
a part of that and I hope one day I 
will see you again.
(beat)
‘I think.. I too am clear now of 
what the purpose of my life is.’
BUS ON A LONE ROAD - DUSK
A bus steadily drives away.
Gayatri is traveling in the scantily crowded bus. In the last 
row. 
She is lost in making various mudras with her fingers and 
hands.
Everyone’s asleep except for a little boy who is looking at 
her curiously.
Then from her bag, she removes the choti of Stree. Looks at 
it. 
Then she slowly attaches the choti to her own hair. And it 
starts to merge into her hair.
The boy’s jaw drops. Gayatri catches him looking at her. And 
stares blankly at him.
Now the choti has merged into her completely.
FADE TO BLACK:
EK SAAL BAAD116."
"117.OUTSKIRTS - LATE NIGHT
It’s the dead of night.
HER POV
Glides along the road, leading into town. 
Eerie.
She arrives at the town entrance. 
And sees -- 
A statue. Of Stree. Complete with ghungat covering her eyes. 
And labeled as ‘Protector of the Town’.
Under it is the inscription: ‘O Stree, Raksha Karo!’
She stares at it for a long moment -- pondering. 
Then, in her signature move, tilts her head to the side with 
a sigh.
