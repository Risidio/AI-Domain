"FADE IN:
EXT. CHITRAKOOT SCHOOL GATES - PLAYGROUND - DAY 3.1 3.1
A hand rings a gong with a hammer. It’s the school bell. *
THREE SCHOOLBOYS - in various stages of teenhood - walk 
towards the school, laughing. Seems like the YOUNGEST BOY, *
13, is regaling them with his stories.
YOUNG SCHOOL BOY
(cute lisp)
Bhai ek aur, ek aur... Ek baar ek launde ne kuchh doston ko apne ghar khaane pe bulaaya. Dost khaa rahe thhe toh launde ki behenein aa ke boli, arey tum logon ne toh kuchh khaaya hee nahi.
ANGLE from behind. Getting NEARER and nearer. It’s like SOMEONE’s following them. Oblivious -
YOUNG SCHOOL BOY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
(lisping)
Toh behnon ne chicken ka ek ek leg piece utha ke ladkon ki plate mein rakh diya. Agle din school mein launde ne doston ko poochha - khaana kaisa thha? Toh dost boley -
That SOMEONE’S right behind them now. The SECOND BOY, 17, feels the presence. TURNS to look.
Which is exactly when - Something SWINGS in the air.A weird sound, a cross between a THUDDDD! and a PHUCHHHHH!In the next instant - a fountain of blood SPURTS out from the 
boy’s smashed head.
The Oldest Boy goes down like a felled tree.The remaining two boys turn in shock. The first thing they 
notice is a HAMMER - blood dripping from it like water from a leaking faucet.
And then the person holding it. Despite the blood splattered 
all over his face, he looks familiar to us. Ah, it’s a MUCH YOUNGER TYAGI, only 17, but the dead cold eyes give it away.
A tense long BEAT. And then the THIRD BOY, 15 years, turns 
around and RUNS towards the school, SCREAMING -
THIRD SCHOOL BOY
MASTERJIIII...!
Tyagi chases him as a DOG in the playground begins to BARK."
"The boy has only made it a few yards across the school 
playground when -
Tyagi JUMPS and lands on his back - taking him down.He pins the boy down - pressing his head against the ground.And then - the hammer SWINGS again. And again. And again.Until - the THUD in the sound is totally replaced by a PHUCH! 
- the sound of a kid playing in mud.
When we finally see the PULVERISED HEAD, we know we wouldn’t 
be able to do that even to a pumpkin.
Tyagi - his face smeared in blood, like he’s performing a 
ritual. He turns to look at the third boy - the youngest one.
The dog. It’s barking its guts out - as if warning the 
Youngest Boy to run.
But - the boy stands rooted with shock and fear. Even when -Tyagi turns and slowly walks up to him.
YOUNG TYAGI
Dost kya boley?
The boy looks at Tyagi - too scared to understand.
YOUNG TYAGI (CONT’D)
Wo jo launde ke ghar khaane pe aaye 
thhe...
The boy fights back tears. Tyagi’s grip tightens around his 
hammer. The boy BLABBERS out - 
YOUNG SCHOOL BOY
(lisping; trying to 
remember)
Dost boley... dost boley... khaana toh theek thha, lekin... lekin last mein teri behenon ne jo taang uthaa ke di... mazaa aa gaya...
The punchline falls flat as Tyagi just stares at him for a long time - totally deadpan.
And then - the hammer SWINGS again. And with it we -
SLAM FADE TO BLACK
TITLE appears - ‘A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE’.SOUND OVERLAY - The harsh grrrrrrrrr of -FADE IN:2."

Sanjeev on a phone call.
FEMALE VOICE ON PHONE (O.S.)
(filtered)
Is this your new number?
SANJEEV
(into the phone)
Haan, wo puraane waala shaayad tap 
ho raha tha.
The woman sighs.
FEMALE VOICE ON PHONE (O.S.)
This country is going to the dogs. Gauri Lankesh ke saath jo hua, wo 
hum mein se kisi ke saath bhi -
She stops herself and lets out an awkward laugh.
FEMALE VOICE ON PHONE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Sorry, mujhe is waqt tum se toh ye baatein nahi karni chahiye... by the way, did you hear? Kapoor is actively looking to invest in a media outlet.
SANJEEV
Who?
FEMALE VOICE ON PHONE (O.S.)
Vikram Kapoor, yaar... tumhaare defence scam waala! Can you even believe it?
Sanjeev - genuinely surprised to hear that. And just then - GRRRRRRRR! The drilling sound takes over.
Sanjeev cups the phone and shouts out at Dolly.
SANJEEV
Dolly! Can we please do this later?
An apologetic Dolly peeps in.
DOLLY
Sorry, sorry. We’re almost done.
She smiles at him - a bit too wide, a bit too reassuring.Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 3."
"DOLLY (CONT’D)
We’ll be safe now. Hai na?
And then she disappears again. An exasperated Sanjeev goes 
back to the phone.
SANJEEV
(into the phone)
Listen Arundhati, I need some help. *
Do you know a good journalist around Chitrakoot? Someone with his ear to the ground...

"EXT. PUNJAB BUS STAND - DAY 3.5 3.5
A noisy bus stand. People, animals and vehicles milling 
about. Ansari gets off from a bus.
AUTO DRIVERS SHOUT out a list of destinations in Punjabi.Ansari walks up to one.
ANSARI
Pind haveliyaan...?

Peeping out from the moving auto, Hathi Ram witnesses the *
first sights of Chitrakoot.And we INTERCUT with - 
EXT. PUNJAB ROAD - MOVING VIKRAM - DAY 3.7 3.7
Ansari balancing precariously on a small seat shared by 
three, driver in the middle.
It’s an area pock marked with several brick kilns . *
The vehicle crosses a sign board - ‘Proprietor - Balbir *
Singh’. *
EXT. CHITRAKOOT ROAD - MOVING AUTO - DAY 3.8 3.8
Vikram crosses a bridge. A curious Hathi Ram looks. It’s a small ghat. Women washing clothes. Naked kids diving 
into the water.

Ansari looks at a brick kiln in the distance as the auto *
passes it by. *
EXT. CHITRAKOOT POLICE STATION - DAY 3.10 3.10
The Vikram stops outside a nondescript building fronted by a 
little courtyard.
Hathi Ram gets down and walks in to realise - the building is *
getting a FRESH PAINT JOB. *
An OLD CONSTABLE, SHALIGRAM, barks at the painters as they *
move around with cannisters and brushes. *
Hathi Ram walks up to a WOMAN CONSTABLE.Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 5."
"HATHI RAM
SHO saab?
WOMAN CONSTABLE
(mouthful of gutkha)
Kaam boliye?
HATHI RAM
Inspector Hathi Ram Chaudhry. Delhi 
Police.
She spits out the gutkha and in a flurry salutes him. 
WOMAN CONSTABLE
SHO saab vidhayak ji ghar gaye hain. Unke pote ka mundan hai. 
From a distance - The Old Constable turns to glance at Hathi *
Ram, who says to the woman constable - *
HATHI RAM
Haath-munh dhona hai. Bathroom...?
WOMAN CONSTABLE
Andar toh gandhaata hai saahab. Bagal mein GG restaurant hai. Apna *
hee samajhiye. Police ID dikhaiye, naashta bhi free of cost milega.
Hathi Ram’s eyes go to the Old Constable - Who quickly turns his gaze away.
EXT. PUNJAB VILLAGE - LANE OUTSIDE BUNGALOW - DAY 3.11 3.11
Ansari walks down a village lane - his bag on the shoulder. 
The kothis indicate that it’s the rich part of the village.
He crosses a big bungalow with a huge iron gate. A name plate 
- BALBIR SINGH.
He notices SOMEONE in the courtyard, playing with his rather 
fierce-looking BULLY KUTTA (PAKISTANI MASTIFF).
ANSARI
(calls out)
Jee suniye... Mahipal Singh ka makaan kahaan padega?
The YOUNG MAN turns to look at Ansari. A dangerous looking SCAR cuts across his entire face.
ANSARI (CONT’D)
Mahipal Singh... wo Tope Singh ka Chacha?
The man doesn’t reply. He just stares at Ansari. Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 6."
"And then - he lets go of his dog. The dog CHARGES at Ansari - 
barking viciously.
Ansari backs off instinctively - as the dog JUMPS. But 
thankfully there’s the gate in between.
The dog continues to bark from behind it - while Ansari 
stares in anger at the Man with the scar. 
As Ansari turns away to walk, a VOICE - 
OLD MAN (O.S.)
Chaaku... oo Manjaaran da munda.
Ansari turns to look - a SENILE OLD MAN, 70, sitting by the 
side of the road.
SENILE OLD MAN
Jaat ka manjaar, par jattan de teen mundeyan nu kaat ditta... shoo-shaan... Andar-bahar, Utte-thalle penchod... 
Ansari looks at him with interest.
ANSARI
Tope Singh ki baat kar rahe ho na?
SENILE OLD MAN
Poora pind, khoonam khoon. Bund paad ti penchodayan di...
Ansari’s intrigued.
ANSARI
Uska chacha kahaan milega? Wo Mahipal Singh...
EXT. PUNJAB VILLAGE - CHAUPAL - DAY 3.12 3.12
The village chaupal. A tense game of ‘seep’ is under way.
A SHORT, WIRY MAN, 40, screws his eyes at the cards he is 
holding. The Village Idiot. We’ll call him CHACHA.
The BIG OPPONENT makes his move.
BIG OPPONENT
Tere kol kadi begum nai auni. Na 
taash ch na zindagi ch.
Everyone around laughs. Chacha eyes them. And then speaks in his shrill voice, which is kinda funny - 
CHACHA
Bhenchodon apni jananiyan sambhal lo tussi oh hee boht hai.7."
"Chacha plays a card. It’s a winning move. The Opponent 
grimaces. Everyone else cracks up.
CHACHA (CONT’D) *
Lag gaye, lag gaye, lag gaye, *
fudduan de lag gaye! O sabton sohni *
begum kee di... Mahipal di! *
Chacha celebrates and grabs all the money. And just then -
ANSARI (O.S.)
Mahipal Singh?
Chacha turns around.
CHACHA
Oh keda bolda Mahipal Singh de agge-
He stops mid-sentence on noticing Ansari’s cop-like demeanor.
EXT. PUNJAB VILLAGE - DERA - DAY 3.13 3.13
Chacha sits with Ansari outside a ‘dera’ (community center).
CHACHA
Oh tan naukri karda eh ji Dilli ch. 
Changi vaddi company eh, saah-sutthre log ne. Biraadri ch nau chamka ta sade munde ne.
ANSARI
Main bhi yahi pata karne aaya hoon ki kahaan naukri karta hai. Kaun log hain jo use bandey maarne ke paise dete hain?
CHACHA
Saabji kiddan di gal kar rahe ho. Twanu koi galti laggi ae.
Ansari stares at Chacha.
ANSARI
Aur jab usne gaaon mein bandey kaate thhe tab kiski galti thhi?
Chacha is put on the back-foot. But tries to protest -
CHACHA
Zaroor pind ch kisi pehnchod ne kan bhare ae twade thaanedaar saab. Apna Tope tan...
ANSARI
Tum thaane chal ke hee maanoge...
Ansari grabs his hand. And starts to drag him along -Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 8."
"CHACHA
(pleading)
Saabji...Lai chalo thane te jee 
bhar ke kutt lo par meri ek gal sun 
lo..galti ohdi hai hi nai, meri ae 
janaab. Phuddu main aa. Main kadi ohde lai kujh kitta hi nai.. 
Ansari stops. Turns to look at Chacha.
EXT. PUNJAB VILLAGE - CHAAKU’S HOUSE - COURTYARD - DAY 3.14 3.14
FLASHBACK
:
Chacha, younger by a few years, sits in the courtyard. Glum.
A little away, CHAAKU’S MOTHER, cries silently. While an OLD 
GRANDFATHER quietly smokes his hukkah.
We can hear SOUNDS of beating and cries coming from a room. 
CHAAKU (O.S.) *
Papa ji, sorry papa ji... galti ho *
gayi papa ji... maaf kar do *
mainu... *
But no one dares to intervene. Finally - CHAAKU’S DRUNK FATHER walks out with a belt in his hands. Chacha immediately rushes to the room.
INT. PUNJAB VILLAGE - CHAAKU’S HOUSE - ROOM - DAY 3.15 3.15
A bruised and battered YOUNG CHAAKU, 16, lies whimpering in a 
corner.
EXT. PUNJAB VILLAGE - GRAFFITI WALL + LANE - DAY 3.16 3.16*
ON a popsicle as it melts away. Chaaku’s holding it as he 
walks alongside Chacha down a village lane.
Chacha looks at him.
CHACHA
Kaake maafi de de yaar. Agli vaari 
asi doven mil ke lamma paadange 
tere pyo nu te ohdi belt na 
kuttange.
Chaaku smiles at him briefly. But we know he’s hurting.
We TRACK ALONG a long village wall as the two walk - Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 9."
"CHACHA (V.O.)
Manjaaron de mundeyan da koi haal 
nai. Ghar ch peyo pee ke kuttda te 
bahar jattan de munde bund len ton 
baaj nai aunde.
Until we come across a graffiti - ‘PUTT JATTAN DE’. And then - legs, dangling down the wall.
It’s a bunch of OLDER BOYS lounging on the village wall.Chaaku notices - Tenses up. And so does Chacha. But it’s too 
late to turn back. They proceed - pretending to be unnerved.
BHUPINDER, 18, the boy we saw earlier with the scar, stands 
up on the wall.
BHUPINDER
Baari barsi khatan gaya si,Khat ke layanda...
JATT BOYS
(chorus)
...MANJAAR!
Bhupinder unties his drawstrings while -
BHUPINDER
Naade khol lao mundeya,Inna di bund deni...
JATT BOYS
(chorus)
...AJ MAAR!
They all laugh. We STAY on Chaaku’s face as Chacha turns to shout at them - 
CHACHA (O.S.)
O sharam karo oye! Ghar jaao apne!
A BULLY mimics Chacha’s shrill effeminate voice - 
BULLY (O.S.)
O sharam karo oye! Ghar jaao apne!
ANOTHER BULLY shouts - 
BULLY-2 (O.S.)
Chacha Manjaar. Bhateeja Manjaar.
A humiliated Chaaku tries hard to control his tears and looks at Chacha - Who grabs his arm, and tries to rush from there.
Bhupinder jumps down the wall and goes after them.10."
"BHUPINDER
Janaani naal kitthe ghum reya Tope 
Singh? Eh tere chacha nai chachi ae.
Chacha and Chaaku hasten their walk - the humiliation ringing in Chaaku’s ears.
BHUPINDER (CONT’D)
Vekhiye Tope Singh di lulli kinni vaddi hai. Tope jinni ya bandook di goli jinni?
Loud laughter from the boys behind. Chaaku can’t take it any more. He grabs a stone and - 
Throws it at them.It doesn’t hit them. But it’s enough to piss them off. 
Bhupinder SHOUTS. Behind - the boys jump down the wall.
CHACHA
(screams)
TOPE! Chal bhajiye etthon.
The popsicle drops from Chaaku’s hand. And he RUNS.
The bullies go after him. And a NERVE-WRACKING CHASE ensues.It’s a mostly silent chase through the village alleys. Where 
we focus on the the sound of Chaaku’s strained BREATH. And the FOOTSTEPS chasing him. And the occasional SHOUT coming from behind.
But most importantly, we focus on the desperation on Chaaku’s 
face. And his visibly primal need to survive through this.
He runs through criss-crossing alleys - trying desperately to 
stay ahead.
Chaaku reaches a T-alley. He can go either way. He turns left 
and runs in that direction. He has only run halfway when - two bullies come running from there.
Chaaku swirls around. And runs in the opposite direction.The bullies chase. But Chaaku’s fast.But just then - His sandals give away. Chaaku stumbles and 
falls - injuring himself.
The bullies gain ground. Getting closer and closer.Chaaku gets up and runs again. His sweat flies all around.All he can see - is the corner at the end of the alley.And the promise of safety that lies beyond it.11."
"He runs - leaving the bullies behind. Looks like he’s going 
to make it.
But as Chaaku turns the blind corner - someone emerges 
running from the other side, right in front of him. And just as Chaaku RAMS into him -
INT. CHITRAKOOT POLICE STATION - DAY 3.17 3.17
PHUT!
SHO RAMAVTAR, late 40s with dyed jet black hair on his 
balding head, dusts off his desk with a file.
PHUT! PHUT! PHUT!
SHO RAMAVTAR *
Is putaayi ke chakkar mein sab *
dhool dhakkad ho rakha hai... *
Hathi Ram waits for him to finish before -
HATHI RAM
Vishal Tyagi ke baare mein kuchh 
bataayenge. Ye Hathoda Tyagi...
SHO look at him.
SHO RAMAVTAR
Badmaashon ka ilaaka hai jee. 
Hathoda lauda... yehi sab hai 
yehaan pe toh. Bhonsadi waale rakt *
beej hain. Prabhu Ram chandar se *
khatam nahi hue, ye SHO Ramavtar *
kya cheez hai... *
Behind - a local news channel PLAYS on a TV, loud enough to 
bother Hathi Ram. But he tries to ignore it.
HATHI RAM
Ye Tyagi khud contract leta hai ya *
kisi aur ke liye kaam karta hai?
SHO RAMAVTAR
(vaguely)
Badmaash aadmi aur kiske liye kaam karega? Paisa. Power. Yehi sab hai.
The two continue the game of sizing each other up.
HATHI RAM
Pehle ke cases mein kin kin logon ka naam aaya tha is ke saath, unki list mil sakti hai?Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 12."
"SHO RAMAVTAR
Aap dilli waale ek dum se suddenly 
is Tyagi mein kahaan se interested ho gaye?
It’s Hathi Ram’s turn to be vague.
HATHI RAM
Ek local case mein naam aaya hai uska...
The SHO doesn’t look entirely convinced -
SHO RAMAVTAR
Accha aisa... local case mein naam 
aaya hai...
And then - something on the TV catches SHO’s attention. He increases the volume.
ON THE TV:
 
EXT. CHITRAKOOT HIGHWAY - DAY 3.17INS 3.17INS
A report on a highway robbery and rape. An over-enthusiastic 
reporter in his early thirties. He is AMITOSH. 
AMITOSH (ON T.V.)
Shaadi huyi aur dulhan apne dulhe ke saath ek nayi duniya basaane ka sapna sanjoye Chitrakoot ko nikal padi.
Hathi Ram follows the SHO’s gaze and turns to the TV.
AMITOSH (ON T.V.) (CONT’D)
Lekin laut-te waqt National highway 76 par us waqt jab UP police chain *
ki neend so rahi thhi, uske saath *
ek dardnaak haadsa ho gaya. 
Anger rises on SHO’s face. He picks up the phone and makes a phone call.
SHO RAMAVTAR
(on the phone)
Yeh NH76 wala rape case jis tehsil mein hua woh Satna jile mein padta hai. Aur Satna MP ka jila hai, hai ke nahi? Toh yeh saala Amitosh kaahe gaand marw a raha hai. Saaley *
ko bolo abhi thane aaye...
(beat)
Arey toh parivaar Chitrakoot ka hua toh hum kya karein... kal bhonsadi waale London Amreeka jaa ke marenge toh hamaari galti hai?Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 13."
"He slams the phone down.
Hathi Ram tries hard to check the irritation in his voice - 
HATHI RAM
Ji mein poochh raha tha ki Tyagi ke 
cases ki detail mil sakti hai?
SHO RAMAVTAR
(shouts)
SHALIGRAM!
SHALIGRAM, the old constable from earlier, appears.
SHO RAMAVTAR (CONT’D)
Ayodhya se Ramchandar ji aaye thhe Chitrakoot. Aur ab Hathi Ram ji aaye hain Dilli se. Sir ko Tyagi ke baare mein jo madad chahiye do. Hamari taraf se koi kami nahi rehni chahiye.
INT. CHITRAKOOT POLICE STATION - RECORD’S ROOM - DAY 3.18 3.18
The room’s a mess. Shaligram points to the rows of files and *
papers that have been stacked up alongside the paint *
cannisters and what have you. *
CONSTABLE SHALIGRAM
Sir jo hai sab yehin hai. Aapko koi *
aur madad chahiye ho toh pukariyega main upasthit ho jaunga.
He straightens his back in a manner of salute, and leaves.
Hathi Ram picks the first file and reads the name on it. It’s 
not Vishal Tyagi.
Second file, same. Third file, same.Hathi Ram sighs and ties a handkerchief around his nose and 
starts looking through a dusty cupboard. *
A few files fall on the ground in the process. He searches among those. Can’t find the one he’s looking for.
Then goes to an almirah. *
Dust flies all over. Some of it goes into his eyes. Damn.More search. No result.A frustrated Hathi Ram sits down. Looks at the cupboard 
angrily. Which is when he notices - 
There are a few files lying on top of the cupboard.Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 14."
"He pulls a chair. Climbs on it.
It looks dusty as hell. He picks up one thick file, wipes the 
layers of dust with his hand.
Voila - It reads Vishal Tyagi .
Hathi Ram flips through the pages. An old picture of Vishal 
Tyagi from his school days, along with other details like case history, address etc.
EXT. CHITRAKOOT POLICE STATION - DAY 3.19 3.19
Hathi Ram walks out and looks around. 
Shaligram seems busy.Hathi Ram quietly sneaks out behind his back.
EXT. CHITRAKOOT STREETS - DAY 3.20 3.20
The streets of Chitrakoot. Hathi Ram walks. 
Up ahead - a small RALLY seems to be heading his way. As 
Hathi Ram crosses them he sees -
A huge banner - ‘Mukhyamantri Kalyani Jiji
 evam Dalit Hriday 
Samrat Balkishan Bajpayee ’. There are also portraits of the 
two leaders alongside Baba Ambedkar’s.Hathi Ram looks at the FACES in the rally. Hopeful. 
Confident. Shouting SLOGANS on Dalit Power.
CHACHA (V.O.)
Je bande kol koi hor raah na hoye na, tan oh sehn kar lenda. Par je tussi ohde mann ch koi navi aas paida kar do...Badi gandu cheej hondi ae ye aas.
EXT. PUNJAB VILLAGE - LANE - DAY 3.21 3.21
FLASHBACK:
 The same scene we saw earlier - Chaaku being 
chased by village bullies. This time in SLO MO. 
Chaaku runs desperately towards that blind turn. And -SLAM! He runs into someone. Falls down.Chaaku looks up from the ground. Realises - it’s Bhupinder.Desperate - Chaaku looks at the other end. Two more bullies 
coming from there.
No way out. Chaaku gives up. Remains slumped on the ground.15."
"CHACHA (V.O.)
Tope nu aas mili jadon sade pind 
dera khuleya...saadi biradari vich 
vi thoda josh aa gaya.
And then - a sound. A distinct BHUT-BHUT-BHUT of an Enfield.
Chaaku turns to look. And so do the bullies.From the dust - a bike emerges in SLO MO glory.Chaaku’s eyes are glued. As it comes closer he realizes - it 
carries a flag on each side - ‘DALIT SHERA’.
And on the bike is the flamboyant SUKKHA, early 20s. He is leading a rally - the Guru Ravidas Jayanti rally. 
Behind him are dozens of bikes with flags followed by a caravan of people.
The Jatt boys reluctantly back away and disappear.Just as - Chacha manages to make his way to Chaaku.
CHACHA
Tu theek hai, Tope?
No reply. Chaaku’s eyes - glued to the bike as it approaches 
them slowly. And then SCREECHES to a stop near them.
Chacha steps back nervously. But the young Chaaku just stares 
at Sukkha with fascination.
The glasses. The dalit shera bandana. The earphones. The 
style. He’s so cool. 
SUKKHA
(to Chacha)
Tere pind vichon rally nikal rahi 
hai. Tu baitha ki tatte sek reyan. 
Biradari da koi khayal hai tainu?
Chacha looks tentative. 
SUKKHA (CONT’D)
Bahut zulam seh laye. Waqt aa gaya 
hun badla len da.
Sukkha’s eyes go to – the besotted Chaaku.
SUKKHA (CONT’D)
Pashaaneya, hero? 
CHAAKU
Sukkha?16."
"SUKKHA
Kaun Sukkha? Main tan haan Danger *
Manjaar. *
He takes off his ear phones and puts it in Chaaku’s ears.
SUKKHA (CONT’D)
Aur es vaari, oudi bund tod deni *
ae. *
And he switches on the music. The beat kicks in. The song’s 
called - what else but - ‘Bund tod deni’. It’s a song about *
the rise of the new Dalit and the Dalit anger.
‘DANGER MANJAAR’ MONTAGE
The SONG continues as we see - *

An Old Tailor at work. He seems to be stitching an inner *
pocket into a pair of trousers. Chaaku - awkward, without his *
pants - stands looking at Sukkha questioningly. Sukkha *
signals him to relax. *
The Tailor finishes up. Hands over the pants. Chaaku wears *
them quickly. But before he can zip them up - Sukkha stops *
him. *
And then he hands him something - his knife. *
Chaaku looks at Sukkha with surprise. Sukkha signals - ‘take *
it’. *Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 17."
"Chaaku takes it tentatively. Flicks it open. And then swings *
it around a few times, his confidence growing with every *
swing. *
He then shuts it tight and deposits it into his inner pocket - *
which is right next to his crotch. He zips up and feels the *
bulge of his manhood - now propped up by the weapon. *

His hands reach his trousers. And he unbuttons.
The bullies - first surprised. And then they laugh out loud.Chaaku unzips his pants. Inside - an inner pocket. But the 
bullies don’t notice that.
Chaaku quietly slips his hand inside the inner pocket as -

Chaaku flashes out his knife and flicks it open.
CHAAKU

Chaaku slashes at Bhupinder’s face. Blood spurts in a line 
like juice from a sliced mango. 
Bhupinder SCREAMS. Reaches for his kirpan. Chaaku stabs him. He falls on his knees. The other bullies charge at him. Chaaku slashes his weapon 
around like a mad artist.
Screaming mouths.Blood-spurting stomachs. Squirting necks. Sliced asses. Blood droplets land on the ground in the pattern of lines - 
like when an artist shakes his brush.
As he finishes - The three Bullies lie slashed and 
humiliated, bleeding from all over. It’s all over in a flash.

AMITOSH
Network, Sir. Is pradesh mein koi hag ke na dhoye toh bhi us tak khabar chali jaati hai. Kayi hathiyaar hain uske, par uska sabse khaas aur bharosemand hathiyaar - Hathoda. Aur is poori chakkar vidya ko sambhaalta hai Donullia ka bhai -
And just then he stops - for he spots a MAN approaching him. Amitosh tenses up.
HATHI RAM
Naam kya hai... uske bhai ka?
But Amitosh’s attention is on the Man - and on his hand which is inside his jacket pocket.AMITOSH (CONT’D)
36."
"The man comes closer. And the hand comes out.
But - it only turns out to be a chit with an address on it.
MAN AT GHAAT
Bhai ji, yehaan purkhon ke pind 
daan ka kahaan pata chalta hai?
Amitosh sighs and points in a direction.
AMITOSH
Wo raha daftar.
It’s a small office. A board hangs outside - ‘Ram Ghat Kriya 
Karm Karyalay’.
The Man leaves. Just as a relieved Amitosh is turning back 
towards Hathi Ram, he spots - 
TWO SHADY LOOKING MEN eyeing them from the tea stall. One of 
them nods at him ever so slightly while the other just stares without blinking.
From his grave expression, it looks like Amitosh knows them.
AMITOSH (CONT’D)
(whispers)
Chalta hoon, Sir. Peechhe mat 
aaiyega.
Hathi Ram doesn’t quite know what’s going on. He looks around discretely -
HATHI RAM
Par... Donullia ka bhai... hai kaun? Kahaan milega?
Amitosh folds his hands in the direction of a nearby temple and SHOUTS ALOUD in the sing song manner of devotees -
AMITOSH
(cryptic)
JAHAAN BHI DEKHOON TU HEE TU, JAI SHIV SHAMBHU, JAI SHIV SHAMBHU! 
And before Hathi Ram can understand anything - he is gone.
And it’s only now that Hathi Ram notices The Men too.He picks up his bag and starts walking towards them.
EXT. CHITRAKOOT GHATS - TEA STALL + ADJACENT LANES - DAY 3.49 3.49
The Men notice. They dunk down their tea and swerve into a 
tiny alley next to the tea shop. 
Hathi Ram rushes behind them.37."
"EXT. CHITRAKOOT GHATS - NARROW ALLEYS + PAAN SHOP - DAY 3.50 3.50
And an EXCITING FOOT CHASE ensues through the narrow alleys.
The men know their Chitrakoot and swerve into this alley and 
that - trying their best to confuse Hathi Ram.
Hathi Ram realises that the bag he is carrying is slowing him 
down further.
He spots a DENTURES SHOP. Without breaking his run, Hathi Ram *
throws the bag towards the DENTURE SHOP GUY. *
HATHI RAM
(without looking back)
BAG KO KUCHH HUA NA... POLICEWALA 
HOON, TERE DAANT TOD DOONGA *
SAARE... *
The confused man watches Hathi Ram run away. *
UP AHEAD IN THE ALLEYS:
A ‘T’. The two Men split up.
Hathi Ram follows the one towards the left.The Man’s quick but Hathi Ram keeps up the chase, despite his 
breathing getting heavy. He manages to get closer and closer to the Man. 
And just when it looks like Hathi Ram’s going to nab the Man -  A bicycle appears from a cross-alley - right in between them. 
Too late for Hathi Ram to avoid crashing into it.
He goes down.The Man turns back to look once. Then runs away.Hathi Ram is hurt. But he gets up and continues the CHASE.
EXT. CHITRAKOOT GHATS - TEMPLE 2 - STAIRS + COURTYARD - DAY 3.51 3.51
The Man reaches a long staircase. Looks behind.
Hathi Ram is still in pursuit - although considerably behind.The Man starts gliding up the stairs.Hathi Ram reaches there and huffs and puffs his way up the 
stairs - he’s clearly not used to this.
By the time he makes it to the top - There is nobody there.He looks around and spots an elderly PRIEST watering the 
plants.Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 38."
"HATHI RAM
(panting; urgent)
Wo jo aaya thha... kahaan gaya?
PRIEST
Joota neeche utaar ke aao. Chalo.
Hathi Ram - breathless - looks at him with disbelief. Then he 
roughly pulls out his shoes and flings them down the stairs.
And runs into the little temple.He goes around the structure.Peeps inside too.Checks the courtyard.No one there.And then he sees - another staircase on the other side. He 
knows - The Man’s gone.
Hathi Ram grunts. Notices - the Priest glaring at him.A dejected Hathi Ram turns around to walk away when - He notices - a PLAQUE at the temple. The plaque reads - ‘Jai Shiv Shambhu! Jai Shiv Shambhu!’Something piques his curiosity. He reads further.‘Shiv Mandir aur Dharamshala. Saujanya se - GG Charitable 
Trust. Founder - Shri Gwala Gujjar ’.
CLOSE ON Hathi Ram as he stares at his reflection on the 
plaque.

His reflection on an elevator door.Ding! It reaches its destination.Sanjeev takes a deep breath and braces himself as the doors

And just then, Sanjeev barges in, followed by Sara.
Jai’s taken aback to see him there. And so is everyone else.An awkward moment.
JAI (CONT’D)
Hey. I... I thought you are on 
leave.
Sanjeev throws some papers on the table. Tyagi’s photo on top of the pile.
SANJEEV
Nine tonight. We’re going out with this story.
Jai and Keerti, the Executive Producer, look at each other.
JAI
But... er, let’s discuss it. Maybe Gayatri can find a way to squeeze it in -
SANJEEV
(sharp)
It’s the story of my
 assassins. And 
I’m doing it.
Everyone shifts about.
JAI
Okay. What do we know of him?
Sara pitches in.
SARA
We know some of his major crimes and their timelines.
JAI
What about his affiliations? Do we know of any political links?Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 40."
"SARA
Er, not as yet. There wasn’t enough 
time to...
A stressed out Keerti looks at Jai.
KEERTI
Look, it’s ten minutes to nine and I don’t even know the story yet. The videos are yet to come in... Just how do we make it work?
SARA
We don’t have any visuals, except a photograph.
Keerti looks at Sara. Not a friendly look.
KEERTI
(losing it)
There are no templates ready, No run downs. No line reporter. No panel. I’m sorry, but this is prime time suicide.
Jai tries to defuse the situation.
JAI
(to Sanjeev)
Are you sure we are can do a story without the whole shebang? Maybe we can do this tomorrow night?
SANJEEV
What if the story leaks out by then? We’re lucky to have landed this anyway.
Jai has no answer. Sanjeev takes charge.
SANJEEV (CONT’D)
We do this, and we do this tonight. One more thing. I don’t want any ticker running. No EPL live scores. No ads. Nothing. Just put me one to one with the viewer.
Keerti throws up her arms in frustration. Sanjeev stares at her and then turns to Sara.
SANJEEV (CONT’D)
Handle the PCR tonight.
Sara looks at Sanjeev with surprise.
Keerti scowls. Even Jai’s a bit taken aback but he tries to 
cover it up with a cheerful -41."

The TV plays in a half-filled restaurant where -
IN A CORNER TABLE:
Hathi Ram sits looking at the logo on the menu - ‘GG Restaurant’.A WAITER comes and puts a bottle of soft drink on the table.Hathi Ram looks at him. Then decides to take a chance.
HATHI RAM
(casually)
Gwala Bhai aate hain kya yehaan?
WAITER
Arre nahi sir, woh yehaan kahaan 
aayenge?
HATHI RAM
Haan wo bhi hai. Waise aajkal office... kahaan baithate hain?
The waiter looks at Hathi Ram -
WAITER
Pata nahi Sir hum ko toh.
And walks away.
Hathi Ram’s eyes follow him as - Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 44."
"The Waiter goes and talks to the MANAGER, who in turn looks 
in the direction of Hathi Ram’s table.
Hathi Ram knows it’s time to leave.He gulps his drink down, keeps the money on the table and 
picks up his bag. 
As he walks towards the exit - His phone starts ringing.Hathi Ram looks at it. It’s DCP Bhagat. *
Hathi Ram answers it and steps out of the restaurant -The Manager’s eyes following him all the way.And we STAY on the door as it swings shut.STAY just a bit more.And then - it swings open again. And a tense Hathi Ram STORMS 
back in.
The Waiter and the Manager watch him suspiciously as he looks 
around and rushes to where the Television Set is.
He changes the channels furiously. Until he finds - NEWS NOW

And finds himself staring at -
