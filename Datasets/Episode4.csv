"FADE IN:
EXT. OLD DELHI RAILWAY STATION - PLATFORM - DAY 4.1 4.1
The BUZZ of a waiting crowd. All heads turned in the 
direction from where -
A train announces its arrival with a screaming HORN. Amidst the sea of people on the platform, stands a 12-year 
old street kid - dark as coal, with eyes cynical beyond his years. Let’s call him the ROUGH KID.
The train halts. The Rough Kid jumps into the AC coach.
INT. OLD DELHI RAILWAY STATION - AC TRAIN COACH - DAY 4.2 4.2
The coach - near-vacant. The Rough Kid walks around searching 
for something, scanning the seats and the aisles.
SOMEWHERE IN THE COACH:
A FAT RICH KID engrossed in his Game Boy. His FAT MOTHER 
tries to heave out her heavy luggage from under a seat when - 
She hears someone CRYING. She turns around.It’s a heartbreakingly pretty boy, 10, with North Eastern 
features. We’ll call him the CUTE KID.
FAT LADY
Kya hua beta?
CUTE KID
(sobbing)
Mummy... Chala gaya... Papa... Chala gaya...
Awwww. Her soft heart melts. She digs into her handbag and offers a packet of biscuit to the boy - who continues to cry.
CUTE KID (CONT’D)
Mummy chaahiye... Papa Chaahiye...
Poor thing! The Fat Lady takes the boy’s face in her hands.
FAT LADY
Ro mat beta. Mata Rani sab theek karegi.
POV on the unattended handbag. Someone’s eyeing it from the aisle. It’s the Rough Kid from earlier.
He makes a SWIFT play to grab at it, and turns around to run."
"But the lady’s son senses something and SHOUTS - without 
looking up from his game, mind you.
FAT RICH KID
MUMMY BAG! MUMMY BAG!!
The Fat Lady realizes. And runs after the Rough Kid.
She manages to grab his shirt. But SUDDENLY -The Rough Kid pulls out something from his shirt and shoves 
it in the Lady’s face - a goddamned TWO-FACED SNAKE! Small but creepy enough to send the Lady shrieking away! 
FAT LADY
SAANP! SAANP! CHOR! CHOR!
As she lets go of him - the Rough Kid manages to slip away.
The Fat Lady turns around. The Cute Kid is gone too.
EXT. LOHA BRIDGE - SLEEPING AREA UNDER THE BRIDGE - DAY 4.3 4.3*
A radio plays a kitschy song: Mujhe neend na aaye...
We’re on the roof of a dilapidated structure. A spread of 
railway lines and trains on either side.
The Cute Kid watches as the Rough Kid rummages through the 
stolen handbag. Out come - cash, bangles, cosmetics, lotions, and a fuck load of accessories - it’s a ladies bag after all!
CUTE KID
(wide eyed)
Kitna hai andar?! *
ROUGH KID *
Ladies ka bag - Jaise unka pet. *
Tere ko lagega ke pet mein se sirf *
tatti nikalti hai, lekin ek din *
puuuut! Poora bachcha baahar nikalta hai.
The Cute one’s just mesmerized by the accessories. He picks something up. While - 
The Rough Kid counts the money. Not much. He checks on the 
bangles. And then throws them away - disgusted. 
ROUGH KID (CONT’D)
Naqli hai saala...! *
He TURNS around. And stops as he notices -
The Cute Kid - wearing LIPSTICK and ROUGE. The Cute Kid looks 
at his older partner - Tentative. Awkward.Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 2."
"The Rough Kid takes a moment to react. Then comes close. And 
slowly touches his friend’s face.
ROUGH KID (CONT’D)
Jachta hai tujh pe.
Their eyes meet. And the unsure Cute Kid lets out a smile.
And the MUSIC picks up. Anuradha Paudwal's cloying voice.
‘Na Jaane Kahaan Dil Kho Gaya....’
FADE OUT:
TITLE appears: ‘SLEEPLESS IN SEELAMPUR ’
Along with - OPENING CREDITS.
FADE IN:
EXT. DELHI ROADS - MOVING AUTO - DAY 4.4 4.4
‘Mujhe Neend Na Aaye, Mujhe Chain Na Aaye...’
Cheap speakers blare out the SAME SONG while Hathi Ram 
struggles to sleep in a rickety auto rickshaw.
His phone rings. He checks. It’s Renu.
EXT. POLICE HQ - DAY 4.5 4.5
The imposing building of the headquarters of Delhi Police. 
The autorickshaw comes to a stop outside.
Hathi Ram gets down and pays up, while talking on the phone - 
HATHI RAM
(on the phone)
Shaam ko aaunga ghar. Abhi toh *
headquarter aaya hoon... *
RENU (O.S.) *
(excited) *
Promotion mil gaya? *
An angry Hathi Ram cuts the phone. *
INT. POLICE HQ - MEETING ROOM - DAY 4.6 4.6
A semi-formal gathering of JOURNALISTS crowding around DCP *
Bhagat, who seems eager to wrap it up.Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 3."
"DCP BHAGAT *
Dekhiye accused ki identity 
disclose na karne ka decision operational thha, taaki investigation weak na ho. Thank *
you. *
Bhagat gets up. The journalists jostle to get that last *
question in.
JOURNALIST ONE
Sir agar ye information sensitive thhi toh fir Sanjeev Mehra ke saath kyun share ki gayi?
Bhagat stops momentarily to answer that - 
DCP BHAGAT *
Jaisa maine bataaya, ye unka judgement error hai. Unko ye information sirf case victim ki haisiyat se di gayi thhi. Hamaari taraf se unko clear instructions thhe case ke baare mein baat na karne ke liye.
JOURNALISTS
Toh sir kya police Sanjeev Mehra ke khilaaf koi action legi? Sir... Sir... kya Hathoda Tyagi jaise kukhyaat apraadhi ki custody ke liye police koi khaas precaution le rahi hai?
This time Bhagat makes his way towards the door without answering them.
EXT. POLICE HQ - CORRIDOR - DAY 4.7 4.7
Officer Dahiya stands outside the door. His eyes follow Hathi 
Ram who hurries down the corridor, lugging his bag.
OFFICER DAHIYA
Ye kya haalat bana rakhi hai, Chaudhari? Ye headquarter hai... media waale hain andar.
Hathi Ram - embarrassed - tries to straighten his shirt and his hair. Too late - as just then DCP Bhagat emerges out, *
followed by the media.
Bhagat spots Hathi Ram and cursorily gives him a once-over . *
DCP BHAGAT *
Tyagi ka naam hold back kar rakha *
thha ki case pe unnecessary *
attention na aaye. Aur ab dekho... *
(MORE)Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 4."
"Commissioner saab bhadke hue hain *
kal se. *
He starts to walk away. Hathi Ram follows awkwardly. *
The journalists try to go after Bhagat but Dahiya expertly 
blocks them with the help of a couple of CONSTABLES. 
DOWN THE CORRIDOR:
Lugging the damned bag, Hathi Ram somehow manages to catch up *
with DCP Bhagat. *
HATHI RAM
I’m very sorry, Sir. Par maine toh 
Mehra ko sirf identification ke liye bulaaya -
DCP BHAGAT *
Ye doosri baar hai, Chaudhari. Isse pehle Mehra ka naam bhi aise hee leak hua thha.
Hathi Ram distraught - not knowing what to say.
DCP BHAGAT (CONT’D) *
Chitrakoot mein kya raha?
HATHI RAM
Sir Tyagi Chitrakoot ke kisi Gwala Gujjar ke liye kaam karta hai...
Bhagat stops to look at him.
INT. POLICE HQ - DCP BHAGAT’S OFFICE - DAY 4.8 4.8*
Bhagat leans on his desk - his eyes on Hathi Ram.
HATHI RAM
Gwala Gujjar wahaan ka businessman 
hai... politically bhi connected hai. Aur sabse khaas baat Sir... UP ke most wanted dacait Donullia Gujjar ka bhai hai.
We can see Bhagat’s interested, and trying to wrap his head around this information.
DCP BHAGAT *
Hmmm. Par is Gwala Gujjar ki Mehra se kya dushmani ho sakti hai?
HATHI RAM
Sir ho sakta hai wo ya Donullia kisi politician ke liye ye kar rahe hon. DCP BHAGAT (CONT'D)
(MORE)Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 5."
"Dashrath Kumar ki constituency 
Allahabad hai Sir... wahaan se zyaada door nahi.
Bhagat looks at him.
DCP BHAGAT *
Interesting lead hai. Follow karo, par sambhaal ke. Bada aadmi hai. 
(beat)
Aur haan, jaa ke Sanjeev Mehra ko mat bata dena.
Ouch! Hathi Ram looks down - embarrassed.
DCP BHAGAT (CONT’D) *
Warning do chutiye ko.
HATHI RAM
Jee Sir.
DCP BHAGAT *
Pehli baar high profile case handle kar rahe ho, Chaudhari. Don’t let these kind of mistakes ruin your good work.
Hathi Ram nods grimly. And salutes.
Bhagat’s eyes follow him as he exits.
EXT. / INT. JAMUNA PAAR POLICE STATION - DAY 4.9 4.9
CLOSE ON a mobile screen - ‘Calling Sanjeev Mehra...’
The phone rings out as Hathi Ram enters the police station. 
Annoyed, he’s about to dial again when -
Head Constable Tokas hurries up to him.
CONSTABLE TOKAS
Sir good morning. Wo Forensic 
waalon ka phone aaya tha. Keh rahe 
thhe phone ka data kal tak ready ho 
jaayega.
Hathi Ram nods.
CONSTABLE TOKAS (CONT’D)
Natthu Sweets se Milk cake aayi hai 
thaane mein. Laaun?
HATHI RAM
Kis khushi mein?HATHI RAM (CONT'D)
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 6."
"CONSTABLE TOKAS
Arey, aapko pata nahi? Ansari sir 
ka IAS ka exam clear ho gaya. Toh 
SHO saab ne party di hai sabko.
Hathi Ram is surprised to hear that. And turns to look - 
SHO Virk having an animated conversation with Ansari. Smiles 
and laughter!
Hathi Ram looks hurt, looks left out.Ansari turns. Their eyes meet. Ansari excuses himself from 
Virk and walks over to Hathi Ram in excitement.
ANSARI
Hello sir. Aap ko ek news -
HATHI RAM
(cold)
Mubarak ho, bhai.
Ansari looks disappointed.
ANSARI
Arey sir aap ko pata chal gaya?
HATHI RAM
Pata toh chalna hee thha. Tere se naa sahi, kisi aur se...
Ansari - taken aback at the coldness. Tries to explain -
ANSARI  
Sir kal sabse pehle aap hee ko phone lagaaya thha. Par lagaa nahi. Toh fir socha face to face bataaunga...
Hathi Ram nods with disinterest, and dials up Sanjeev Mehra again. Ringing. As he waits -
ANSARI (CONT’D)
Aur sir us Tope Singh ke baare mein ek nayi lead mili hai...
Hathi Ram doesn’t look too interested, even as Ansari goes on-
ANSARI (CONT'D)
Ek girlfriend hai uski - Chanda. 
Dono ne saath mil kar Shauki ke 
business mein gadbad ki thhi. 
Shayad is Chanda ko pata ho Tope 
Singh ke baare mein... ki ab kiske 
liye kaam karta hai.
Hathi Ram’s phone rings out. Annoyed he cuts it and turns to Ansari. 7."
"HATHI RAM
Hmmm... dhoondho fir. Shaayad ye 
bhi mil jaayegi, us Tariq ki tarah.
Ouch! Ansari looks at Hathi Ram - hurt. Hathi Ram turns away.
His eyes go to a figure suspiciously looking around. It’s the 
Dark Man  we saw earlier in Episode 2.
HATHI RAM (CONT’D)
Haan bhai... tu kaun hai?
The Dark Man awkwardly shows the glasses of tea he is serving.
DARK MAN
Wo saab... main Bhotu chaiwala ke 
yehaan se... wo beemar hai aaj.
Before Hathi Ram can ask more, the Dark Man scurries away.
INT. NEWS NOW OFFICE - ELEVATOR - DAY 4.10 4.10
Sanjeev in an elevator. Glued to his mobile screen. 
He’s checking his Twitter feed.INSERT TEXT:
@Trollonaroll - What a killer story this is turning out to 
be. Waiting for more #SanjeevMehraKaKiller
@TwitterTyrant - Sanjeev Mehra ‘hammered’ it home last night 
# Hathoda Tyagi
The elevator stops. The door opens.
INT. NEWS NOW OFFICE - RECEPTION - DAY 4.11 4.11
Sanjeev walks towards his office instructing the RECEPTIONIST-
SANJEEV
If anyone calls from Delhi Police, 
I’m busy.
He stops when he sees the look on the Receptionist’s face. He follows her gaze to see - 
Hathi Ram sitting there - staring at him. He gets up.
HATHI RAM
Toh aapne identification mein 
jhooth kahaa ki aapne Tyagi ko nahi pehchaana?8."
"SANJEEV
(awkward)
Chaliye mere office mein baat karte 
hain...
Hathi Ram remains where he was.
HATHI RAM
Maine aapse kahaa tha case se 
related koi bhi information ho toh pehle mujhse baat baarein... Chhote 
bachche ho aap ki itni si baat 
aapko samajh nahi aayi?
Sanjeev looks at him sharply and raises an angry finger.
SANJEEV
Ek minute, Inspector. Tum bhool rahe ho, media ko kisi se 
permission lene ki zaroorat nahi.
HATHI RAM
Bhool aap rahe ho. Case police 
solve karti hai, media nahi.
The two stare at each other with hostility. Until - Sanjeev turns to his receptionist.
SANJEEV
(stern)
No more visitors without appointment.
He turns and walks away. A fuming Hathi Ram watches him go.
INT. NEWS NOW OFFICE - FLOOR - DAY 4.12A 4.12A
Sanjeev walks in. Jai notices him and comes towards him.
JAI
Hey. Singh saab wants to meet.
Sanjeev doesn’t respond and continues to walk. An awkward Jai 
follows -
JAI (CONT’D)
Look, he’s obviously not very happy that you did the show last night.
Sanjeev walks into - 
INT. NEWS NOW OFFICE - SANJEEV'S CABIN - DAY 4.12B 4.12B
His cabin. Flowers and bouquets kept on the table.9."
"SANJEEV
But seems like the rest of the 
world is.
He turns to Jai. 
SANJEEV (CONT’D)
I’d think it’s not the right time to fire me. Public sympathies are a dangerous thing to go against, you know...
(beat)
You should tell him... since you have his ear.
Jai’s about to say something in protest but stops, for just then - 
Sara knocks and walks in.Jai gives her a dirty look, and walks out.
SARA
(referring Jai)
What was that?
SANJEEV
Compliments for the show last 
night.
Sara lets out a smile.
SARA
It was good, wasn’t it?
Sanjeev smiles and walks up to her. And leans in.
The two kiss each other passionately for a bit, before Sara 
pulls herself back with some effort.
SARA (CONT’D)
No... not in the office, Sanjeev.
Smiling, she turns to walk away. But then remembers something-
SARA (CONT’D)
You going for the Awards Night by any chance?
Sanjeev shrugs with disinterest.
SANJEEV
What’s the point?
SARA
Free booze, for one. And the chance to hear Vikram Kapoor speak about the responsibilities of Media.10."
"Sanjeev’s surprised to hear that.
SANJEEV
What??
SARA
Yeah, he is one of the guest *
speakers. Can you even believe 
it???
She shakes her head and walks out.
But it has left Sanjeev thinking.
INT. HATHI RAM’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 4.13 4.13
Evening. Funky LED lights glow all over Jitu’s soda machine 
as it HISSES and spits out red liquid. *
INT. STUDIO - DAY 4.13INS 4.13INS *
ON THE TV:  A Chinese infomercial CD plays. The dubbed OVER 
ENTHUSIASTIC HOST sounds like she’s selling the cure for cancer.
A few of RENU’S FRIENDS watch the infomercial with 
disinterest while Renu serves them the bubbly drink.
Renu looks at them with anticipation as they sip their drink.
RENU
Kaisa laga?
The women nod and make polite noises - clearly not super-
thrilled by it. 
And just then - TING TONG! The doorbell rings.Renu’s eyes go to the clock. Shit!Her mind races as she makes her way to the door. Then stops 
and turns back. Switches off the infomercial on the TV while smiling politely at the guests.
RENU (CONT’D)
Lo naa... main abhi aayi.
AT THE DOOR:
Renu opens the door. It’s Hathi Ram there.
RENU (CONT’D)
Jaldi aa gaye? Matlab... mujhe laga late hogey roz ki tarah...Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 11."
"Hathi Ram looks at her - Tired. Sleepy. Grumpy. Without 
answering, he makes his way in. Only to be surprised by - 
The kitty party.
HATHI RAM
(awkward)
Hello jee, hello!
The Women acknowledge with ‘hellos’ and ‘namastes’.Awkward silence. Renu salvages it by turning to Hathi Ram -
RENU
Aap andar aaraam kar lo...
(to her gang)
Out of station gaye thhe na... *
INT. HATHI RAM’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY 4.14 4.14
Hathi Ram drags himself in. Stumbles as his leg hits 
something.
Hathi Ram switches on the light and looks in irritation. It’s 
a stack of ‘Fusion Fizz’ cartons.
Renu walks in with a glass of water. Notices - Hathi Ram 
staring at the cartons.
HATHI RAM
Tune toh kaha Jitu chala gaya?
RENU
(evasive)
Ek do din ki baat hai... saamaan bhi le jaayega...
She scurries away, muttering -
RENU (CONT’D)
Pata nahi Sid kahaan reh gaya...
Hathi Ram shakes his head as he watches her go.

Sid, along with his friends, follows Raju Bhaiyya up a 
staircase. He is on a call.
RAJU BHAIYYA

"Aur aaj toh Bangladesh hee le ke *
jaayega, pakki baat...
They cross the terrace to reach a ‘barsaati’ (terrace room).
Sid notices - Raju Bhaiyya picks up the room key from the 
ledge and unlocks the door.
RAJU BHAIYYA (CONT’D)

Raju ends the conversation and throws the phone on the bed.
RAJU BHAIYYA

Sid has spotted something on the window ledge. 
SID
Woh...
Raju Bhaiyya follows his gaze and sees - Rolling paper.
RAJU BHAIYYA
Rehen de bhai English Medium. 
Danger cheez hai ye... bam bam bhonsada ho jaayega...
SID 
Maine school picnic mein kiya hai...
RAJU BHAIYYA
Je baat? Toh jaa almaari mein se 
maal le ke aa. Pehla drawer.
Sid walks up to the cupboard. Opens the drawer. 
There's the ‘maal’ (hashish). And then he spots something 
else - A pistol
.
Sid is transfixed. He touches it tentatively.
Somewhere behind in the room - a phone rings O.S. And then a 
voice - 
SID’S FRIEND (O.S.)
Teri mummy ka phone hai, Siddhu...
It startles Sid - who hurriedly takes out the ‘maal’ and walks away.RAJU BHAIYYA  (CONT'D)Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 13."
"The gun remains lying there - looking rather ominous.
INT. JAMUNA PAAR POLICE STATION - MALE LOCK UP - NIGHT 4.17 4.17
The stark and ugly lock up room. It’s quiet - except for 
Kabir sobbing in a corner.
Chaaku lies on the floor - staring at the tattoo on his arm. 
He touches the tattoo gently with his other hand, tracing the shape of the moon.
A tear drop appears in his eye. A rare moment of 
vulnerability.
He feels something. And looks up to realize - Tyagi’s looking at him.Chaaku quickly and discretely wipes off his tear. And the 
hardness returns to his face.
Chaaku jumps to his feet. He walks up to Kabir and with his 
eyes on Tyagi - kicks Kabir hard.
CHAAKU
Rona bandh kar bhenchod.
Kabir whimpers. 
CHAAKU (CONT’D)
Chupp... ekdum chupp!
Kabir muffles his sobs.
Chaaku grins at Tyagi - who just continues to stare at him 
with the same dead cold eyes.
INT. JAMUNA PAAR POLICE STATION - FEMALE LOCK UP - NIGHT 4.18 4.18
Cheeni sleeps on a tattered blanket. She’s the only one in 
the female lock up. Until - 
The door swings open. Manju Verma shoves in a loud mouthed *
woman, possibly a STREETWALKER.
MANJU VERMA *
Chal! Raand saali...
STREETWALKER
Randi boliyo apni maa ko...
Manju raps the Woman’s feet with her stick. The Woman *
SHRIEKS.As Manju locks the door, the Streetwalker shouts out to no *
one in particular -Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 14."
"STREETWALKER (CONT’D)
Bhenchod aaj aakhiri din thha 
dhandha karne ka... kal se maheena chaalu hai mera.
She turns and notices Cheeni.
STREETWALKER (CONT’D)
Tujhe kahaan se uthaaya? Shalimar Bridge? 
Cheeni doesn’t reply. The Streetwalker walks up to Cheeni - 
STREETWALKER (CONT’D)
Tum Nepalanon ka area toh wahi hai... 
And tries to pull the blanket from under her.
Cheeni resists, taking the Streetwalker by surprise. In 
response, the woman applies more force. But Cheeni holds on to the blanket.
Annoyed, the woman kicks at Cheeni - once, twice. The third 
time, Cheeni manages to grab her leg and bites into it.
The Streetwalker shrieks. Her face hardens as she stares at 
Cheeni with venom. And then she pounces upon Cheeni - grabbing her throat by one hand and her other hand goes to Cheeni’s crotch.
STREETWALKER (CONT’D)
BHEN KI LAU -
She stops. And almost recoils back in shock.
With shocked eyes, she looks at Cheeni. And then at her 
crotch.
INT. HATHI RAM’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT 4.19 4.19
A bucket under a flowing tap, overflowing.
In front of it, Hathi Ram sits on a footstool - nodding off.He ‘drops forward’. His forehead hits the tap. Hathi Ram comes to with a YELP, rubbing his forehead.He shuts the tap. Then picks the bucket and POURS it over 
himself - All of it. 
Yeah, that feels better!As he wipes himself clean with a towel, he overhears -15."
"RENU (O.S.)
Teen sau rupaye ke cylinder mein 
dedh sau glass bante hain. Matlab ek glass bas two rupees ka... *
Something odd about it. He strains to listen.
RENU (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Aur agar mahina khatam hone se pehle book kiya toh 20% discount bhi hai..
It sounds like a sales pitch. What’s going on here?
INT. HATHI RAM’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT 4.20 4.20
Renu walks into the bedroom with a glass of sparkling water.
RENU
Sorry, inko teen baje bulaaya thha, ab jaa ke aayin - *
Hathi Ram stands there staring at her. Somewhere on the bed, his phone’s loudly ringing but Hathi Ram’s not even looking at it.
HATHI RAM
Jitu ka saamaan hai toh tu kyun 
bech rahi hai?
Renu - caught off guard. But tries to dodge it -
RENU
Kya...? Nahi aise hee. Achcha chai *
chhodo, aaj ye piyo... Crazy *
Cranberry flavour - *
HATHI RAM
Phir se topi pehna gaya na tera bhai tujhe? Ab ki baar kitne ka fatka maara?
She looks at his stern face. And realizes - that he knows.
RENU
Aisa nahi hai. Ye waali scheme *
bahot sahi hai. *
HATHI RAM
Bante ka thela pakda gaya tujhe...
Renu makes a face.
RENU
Itne negative ho na tum Hathi Ram Chaudhari. Ditto Daddyji ki copy... *Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 16."
"Renu walks away in a huff even as Hathi Ram snaps at her -
HATHI RAM
Unko beech mein mat laaya kar...
He stands there, fuming.
Behind - His phone begins to ring again. Annoyingly loud. 
Ansari calling...
Finally, Hathi Ram picks it up and snaps -
HATHI RAM (CONT’D)
Haan kya hai?
What he hears first leaves him confused - 
HATHI RAM (CONT’D)
Kya???
And then drains the colour off his face.
INT. JAMUNA PAAR POLICE STATION - MALE LOCK UP - NIGHT 4.21 4.21
The Streetwalker is going bonkers - *
STREETWALKER (O.S.) *
Case thokungi tum sab pe... Mujhe *

safety bhi kuchh hoti hai ya nahi? *
A NIGHT DUTY CONSTABLE pulls Cheeni out of the ladies lock *
up. *
The door of the male lock up is flung open and Cheeni is *
thrown in there. *
Chaaku, Hathoda and Kabir look at her with surprise. And she *
at them with fear. *
Just then - *
INT. JAMUNA PAAR POLICE STATION - NIGHT 4.22 4.22
Hathi Ram barges into the police station. Looks around.
He spots Manju Verma - Who is on the phone, worried. She cuts 
the call the moment she sees Hathi Ram. And rushes up to him with guilt in her eyes.
MANJU
Sir sorry sir... Maine toh total check kiya thha sir...
Hathi Ram stares her down. Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 17."
"From the ladies’ lock up, the drama continues -
STREETWALKER (O.S.)
First time nahi aayi main... Saara 
kaanoon pata hai mujhe chutiyon... *
HATHI RAM
ISE CHUP KARAAO KOI!
The lady constable rushes into the female lock up with a stick. Soon - SOUNDS of beating and shrieking reach us.
Hathi Ram himself charges towards the male lock up.
INT. JAMUNA PAAR POLICE STATION - MALE LOCK UP - NIGHT 4.23 4.23
Hathi Ram barges in. Looks around. 
Cheeni stands up in fear - like admitting her guilt.
HATHI RAM
Pant utaar.
Cheeni looks at him. And begins to cry.  
CHEENI
Sir please sir... please...
Hathi Ram rushes to her. Grabs her by the throat. Nails her 
against the wall. 
HATHI RAM
Pant utaar.
The curious constables peep in from outside the lock up.
Cheeni coughs. Hathi Ram tightens the grip. 
HATHI RAM (CONT’D)
(roars)
UTAAR PANT BHENCHOD!
She chokes. He still doesn’t let go of her.Struggling to breathe - she unbuttons herself from that 
awkward position. And pulls her pants down with desperation. 
Finally - she stands naked from the waist down. Hathi Ram lets go of her as he stands there staring at the 
lower half of her body.
Beat. A deathly silence.And then - Chaaku begins to LAUGH. It’s a mocking, uproarious 
laughter. And it cuts through Hathi Ram.Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 18."
"He loses it all. And pounces on to Cheeni, THRASHING the 
living daylights out of her. She SCREAMS out her apologies, but Hathi Ram is like a man possessed.
He barrages her with fists, slaps and kicks. Ansari winces at 
the nastiness of it all and tries to stop, but just can’t.
So much so - that even Chaaku goes silent watching the 
brutality unfold.
The tiny Cheeni BLACKS OUT. And crumples to the floor.Note:
 We shall continue to refer to Cheeni in the feminine 
gender in this episode so as to avoid confusion.
FADE TO BLACK.
ON BLACK - Sound of an ‘aarti’ (prayer) being sung.FADE IN:
INT. JAMUNA PAAR POLICE STATION - DAY 4.24 4.24
Early morning. A small idol of Hindu goddess Durga near the 
window. Incense sticks burning. The constables and junior officers stand singing the aarti.
Bhati, without his shoes and his arm still in a sling, leads the aarti with ultra-devotion.
Ansari, sleeping at his desk, wakes up with the sound. *
He notices - Bhati glancing at him. *
Ansari - awkward, conscious. He drifts away from there -Towards the lock up.He peeps in. Stops at what he sees.AT HATHI RAM’S DESK:
Hathi Ram - passed out on the desk awkwardly.Ansari wakes him up.
ANSARI
Sir... usko hosh aaya hai...
A groggy Hathi Ram rubs his fiery red eyes. As he gets up 
massaging his stiff neck - Tokas appears with ‘prasad’.
TOKAS
Sir, mata ka prasad.
He gives it to Hathi Ram and then looks at Ansari.Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 19."
"An awkward beat - before Ansari spreads his palm out.

The bruises. The swollen lip. The shame in her eyes.
Cheeni looks fucked as she sits in front of Hathi Ram.Hathi Ram leans in closer to her. She cowers in fear.
HATHI RAM

Dekh. Aur maarunga, toh mar jaayega-
CHEENI

Mukesh Talreja.
He looks at her with interest.
HATHI RAM

CHEENI
Builder hai... Vaishali mein. 
HATHI RAM
Usne paise diye murder ke liye?
CHEENI
(quickly)
Murder nahi sir... Uske aadmi ka 
phone aaya thha. Bola do lakh denge... Bas gaadi ke saath mein rehna hai, teen chaar din...
HATHI RAM
Aur...?
CHEENI
Bas sir... iske alaawa mujhe kuchh nahi karna thha.
HATHI RAM
Sirf gaadi mein ghoomne ke do lac milte hain? Ye Talreja sasural waala hai tera?
Cheeni looks cornered. Fights back her tears.
CHEENI
Sir wo ladki saath ho toh log shaq nahi karte...
HATHI RAM
Isliye ladki ban ke ghoomta hai, chutiye?20."
"She looks at Hathi Ram - with tears in her eyes.
CHEENI
Nahi sir... main...
HATHI RAM
Kaise jaanta hai is Talreja ko?

Virk’s car comes to a stop there. Damn!
Virk jumps out. Stares at Hathi Ram for some time. And then -
SHO VIRK 
Manju kahaan hai? Usey le ke mere 
cabin mein aao...
HATHI RAM
Sir usey serious warning di hai... bechaari se galti ho gayi...
Virk explodes.
SHO VIRK
Galti? Ye tum log investigation kar rahe ho yaa makhaul? Bhenchod kal ko enquiry hui toh sabse pehle yehi poochhenge na ki SHO kaun thha?
Hathi Ram walks to him. 
HATHI RAM

He takes a few steps towards the police station. Realises - Hathi Ram hasn’t followed.
Virk turns to glare at him.
SHO VIRK (CONT’D)
Ab chaloge bhi?Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 21."
"When Hathi Ram still doesn’t move, Virk SHOUTS -
SHO VIRK (CONT’D)
Chaudhari! Aa rahe ho ki nahi???
Hathi Ram walks up to him. And then - to Virk’s surprise - 
Hathi Ram takes Virk by the arm and takes him to a corner - away from Ansari.
Virk glares at him - enraged. Hathi Ram pleads with honesty -
HATHI RAM
Virk, please yaar. Dekh hum dost 
toh nahi hain... par bees saal se jaanta hoon tujhe. Ek mauka mila hai life mein. Please meri maa mat chod.
Virk stares at him. Hathi Ram looks rather vulnerable.
HATHI RAM (CONT’D)
Chaubees ghante de de. Ek solid lead mili hai is ladki se... 
(embarrassed; corrects 
himself)
Matlab launde se. Usko follow kar lene de. Shaayad kuchh Bhagat ko bataane laayak mil jaaye. Usi ke saath ye bhi bataa doonga.
Virk wrestles his arm free from Hathi Ram’s grip.
SHO VIRK
Bahot mushkil se pahoncha hoon yehaan. Meri reputation kharaab hui na...
Hathi Rom nods.
EXT. DELHI OUTSKIRTS - TALREJA HISTORICA - DAY 4.28 4.28*
A flashy advertisement promising a historical lifestyle in *
today’s Delhi. Project name? The rather odd sounding - *
‘Talreja Historica’. *

A police car comes to a stop. Hathi Ram and Ansari get down 
and look around.
INT. TALREJA HISTORICA - RECEPTION - DAY 4.29 4.29*

"She greets Hathi Ram and Ansari with a chirpy -
RECEPTIONIST

Her spirit dampens when Ansari shows her his ID.
ANSARI

The Receptionist makes a face. Then picks up the phone. 
Presses a few buttons.
RECEPTIONIST

She leaves. Hathi Ram looks around. As soon as he sits on the 
soft sofa, he sinks in comfortably.
ON THE TV :

The snoozy background score in the infomercial. The 
comfortable sofa. The mocktail. Hathi Ram feels drowsy.

BLUR. And the voices - DISTORTED.When Hathi Ram’s eyes and ears slowly gain focus again - ON THE TV

The Boy looks oddly different. He is now wearing a frock and 
talks effeminate. He walks CLOSER to the Camera -
INFOMERCIAL BOY
All my friends are so jealous of me. They call me lucky boy!
Hathi Ram can’t make sense of it. The Boy walks further close. And then some more. And then -
He is out of the TV. He walks right up to Hathi Ram - Who 
just stares at him with horror.
INFOMERCIAL BOY (CONT’D)
(in Cheeni’s voice)
Mujhe maaf kar do sir, please...
Hathi Ram comes to with a start. He looks about - There’s no boy, of course. A tired Ansari is passed out on the nearby sofa.

An angry Hathi Ram storms out of the flat. Ansari follows.

Hathi Ram and Ansari sit opposite to someone  in a posh cabin.
And WE ARE  in that cabin. In front of them sits TALREJA, 50s. 
You wouldn’t trust him with your money. Or your daughter.
Hathi Ram stares at the CCTVs with a quiet rage. The fat 
bastard was in there watching them the whole time!
TALREJA
Kaam ki cheez hai hamaari line mein ye CCTV. Buyer jis tarah sample flat dekhta hai, usi se uska intention samajh aa jaata hai. 
He smiles at them.

bayaan pe.
Hathi Ram stares back at him.
TALREJA (CONT’D)
Aur kitna peeta bechaare ko... usse

"TALREJA (CONT’D)
Jitna pata thha bata diya. Ab aur 
kuchh poochhna hai toh warrant hee

karta hai us par...
Just then - Ansari appears back to whisper something in Hathi 
Ram's ear.
Hathi Ram turns to look at him sharply. Ansari’s face says it 
all - something's wrong.
Talreja watches them as they rush out.He picks up the phone to make a call.
EXT. YAMUNA BANK - DAY 4.34 4.34
Late evening. A filthy river bank. Pigs rolling.
A LITTLE CROWD hangs around. A FEW POLICEMEN mill about, with 
handkerchieves tied around their noses.
Hathi Ram and Ansari stand looking at a dead body covered in 
sewage. It lies bent over - face not visible.
HATHI RAM
(to constables)
Seedha karo isko.
Two constables shove their stick under it. And turn it over.
Hathi Ram looks at Ansari. Ansari tentatively moves in closer 
- the handkerchief tight around his nose. Pours water on his *
face from a bottle. *
As the face becomes clearer - Disappointment comes on *
Ansari’s face. He slowly turns to look at Hathi Ram. *
ANSARI
Wahi hai sir... Taariq.
A defeated Hathi Ram stands there - staring at the body.
ANSARI (CONT’D)
Sorry sir, usi din pakad lena chahiye thha.
HATHI RAM

Post mortem ke liye bhejo isko.
Ansari walks away to give instructions to the local cops.
Hathi Ram takes out his phone. Searches his contact. Finds - 
‘DCP Bhagat Sir’. *Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 29."
"His hand hovers over the call button, trying to gain the 
courage to press it. A long moment passes. And just when he is about to press it - 
His phone rings. It’s Tokas.Hathi Ram answers it.
HATHI RAM (CONT’D)
Haan bol Tokas.
TOKAS (O.S.)

Hathi Ram cuts the phone. Looks around.
His eyes go to - the dead body.He gathers himself. Then slowly gets up and walks up to it.He sits down right next to the body. Observes it. Ansari notices him and walks up to Hathi Ram -Who seems to have spotted something around the neck area of 
the body.
Hathi Ram pours some water from his bottle there to wash the 
filth off.
Strangulation marks become visible around the throat.He turns to look at Ansari.
HATHI RAM
Gala dabaaya hai kisi ne. *
Then he gets up, turns around and walks away with 
determination - making a phone call.

He’s Kapoor. Wo defence consultant...
DOLLY

The one you had exposed in that Dashrath Kumar sting?
Sanjeev nods, and sighs.
SANJEEV
This town has a rather short memory. It forgets its villains too soon... 
(beat)
And its heroes even sooner...
Dolly stares at Kapoor with unease as he hands over the trophy to the WINNING JOURNALIST and poses for pictures.
She leans in closer to Sanjeev and whispers anxiously -
DOLLY
You think it’s him... the one 
behind that attack on you?
Sanjeev too stares at Kapoor, then knocks back his drink and gets up -
SANJEEV
Good question. Let me go and ask him.31."
"Dolly tries to stop him - 
DOLLY
No, Sanjeev. Don’t!
But Sanjeev’s gone.
EXT. FIVE STAR HOTEL - LAWNS - OPEN BAR - NIGHT 4.36 4.36
His eyes following Kapoor, Sanjeev walks past the GUESTS - 
shaking a hand here, saying a hello there.
Just then, a voice from behind - 
SINGH SAAB (O.S.)
Congratulations on the show last 
night.
Sanjeev turns to see - Singh Saab and Singh Junior there.
SINGH SAAB (CONT’D)
It was good to see some of that old fire back.
Singh Saab turns to his son.
SINGH SAAB (CONT’D)
You know what is the most important quality of a television anchor?
(beat)
He always knows when it’s time to pack up. Hai ki nahi Sanjeev beta?
Sanjeev keeps quiet.
SINGH SAAB (CONT’D)
The PR team is drafting an announcement for next week. Tumhaari taraf se aayega toh 
resignation lagega, aur hamaari 
taraf se aaya toh firing. Bekaar misunderstanding create hogi...
SANJEEV
Hmmm. Misunderstanding toh ho sakti hai sir. Aap ki company RC Holding 
ki ek shell company hai - Future Pride. Future Pride ke Board of Directors mein ek sleeping partner 
hai, jo Transport Minister Rameshwar Verma ka daamaad hai. 
Wahi Rameshwar Verma jisne kuchh 
maheene pehle RC Holding ko Delhi 
Sonipat Expressway ka three thousand crores ka contract diya thha.

"Ab agar ye news baahar aayi, toh 
kaafi misunderstanding ho sakti

Singh stares at him with a quiet fury.
Sanjeev’s eyes go to - somewhere behind Singh. It’s Kapoor, 
headed into the hotel building.
SANJEEV (CONT’D)
Enjoy the evening, sir.
He walks away from there, leaving Singh fuming.
EXT. FIVE STAR HOTEL - LAWNS - NIGHT 4.37 4.37
Dolly sits alone, looking rather anxious.
She dials Sanjeev’s number, glancing all around. She can’t 
see him anywhere.
And even the call goes unanswered.Dolly notices - Her hand begins to shake. And the voices 
around start to fade out.
She gets up and walks in the direction Sanjeev went - Looking around, walking past the guests...PRATIMA, one of Sanjeev’s colleagues, spots her.
PRATIMA
Hi, Dolly!
Dolly looks at her - blank. Pratima’s surprised.
PRATIMA (CONT’D)
Remember me? Pratima... from 
Sanjeev’s office?
DOLLY
Oh! Hi!
Pratima introduces the person she was talking to. It’s Sara.
PRATIMA
That’s Sara. And that’s Dolly, Sanjeev’s wife.
An awkward Sara smiles politely at Dolly.
DOLLY
I...I’m looking for my husband.SANJEEV (CONT'D)

"PRATIMA
They’re always difficult to hold on 
to, aren’t they?
But the joke’s lost on Dolly as she continues to look around.
Pratima makes a ‘weird’ face at Sara, and waves at someone 
and excuses herself from there.
Sara looks at Dolly - who’s all lost. Sara touches her gently.
SARA
Are you all right, Mrs Mehra?
Dolly looks at her.
INT. FIVE STAR HOTEL - WASHROOM - NIGHT 4.38 4.38
ANGLE ON a sparkling clean urinal. A stream of pale yellow 
liquid hits it.
It’s Kapoor taking a piss. He notices - someone comes up in 
the urinal adjacent to him. Sanjeev.
KAPOOR
Kaise ho Mehra?
Sanjeev turns. And pretends to be surprised to see him there.
SANJEEV
Oh hello, Vikram.
Kapoor stares at him with an understated hostility.
KAPOOR
Camera wagairah toh nahi hai na 
saath mein? Fir se koi sting 
operation toh nahi karne waale?
SANJEEV
I was only doing my job, Vikram. Nothing personal.
He looks at Kapoor, and lets out a friendly smile.
SANJEEV (CONT’D)
Waise bhi, ab aap kahaan sting 
operation se darne waale ho? I hear 
you’re planning to enter the media industry yourself...
KAPOOR
News travels fast around here.34."
"SANJEEV
Not that hard to guess, you know. 
The dynamics of the game have changed. Kuchh saal pehle tak, it 
was all about staying under the radar for someone like you.
Sanjeev finishes up and walks to the wash basin. Washes his hands.
Kapoor follows suit - suspiciously eyeing him in the giant 
mirror.
KAPOOR
And now?
SANJEEV
Well, now it’s about owning the radar.
Kapoor finally lets out a smirk.
KAPOOR
I do have plans. Tumhaare Singh Saab ko bhi offer diya thha, but it 
didn’t work out.
They walk towards the door. Sanjeev holds it open for Kapoor.
SANJEEV
Maybe I can help open a few doors for you.
Kapoor looks at him with a sudden interest.
Then steps out of the door. Sanjeev follows.
INT. FIVE STAR HOTEL - LOBBY - NIGHT 4.39 4.39
Kapoor hands over his business card to Sanjeev.
KAPOOR
Then maybe we should get together 
and have a chat...

Off camera, of course.
The two share a parting laugh. Just then, Sanjeev’s eyes go to - 
Sara - who stares at the sight of him hobnobbing with Kapoor.And then he notices - Dolly’s with her.Sanjeev’s quite taken aback as Dolly and Sara walk up to him.35."
"DOLLY
Sanjeev! I was so worried...
Sanjeev tries to hide his irritation.
SANJEEV
Relax, Dolly. It’s all good.
Awkward silence. Sara looks at him with a hint of an 
accusation -
SARA
Hey! I thought you weren’t coming tonight.
SANJEEV
And God knows why I did!
(to Dolly)
Chalein?
He turns around and starts to walk away. Dolly follows, while waving a goodbye to Sara - 
DOLLY
You should come home sometime!
Sara smiles, her eyes following Dolly.

A CLOSE UP of Sanjeev. It looks like he’s sitting in his car. 
It’s a PICTURE on a large iMac screen.Hathi Ram and Ansari peer in from behind as a grumpy FORENSIC 
EXPERT shows it to them in his cubicle.
The office looks like a dull graphic design studio. Not too 
many employees around, given the hour.
GRUMPY FORENSIC EXPERT

TYAGI’S VOICE (O.S.)
Haan.
CHAAKU’S VOICE (O.S.)
Abhi karna hai? Koi nahi hai...
But just then - Dolly walks out of the house, with a dog 
bowl.
She calls out the stray dog ‘Savitri’. And it quickly makes 
its way to Dolly, wagging its tail.
The dog goes to Sanjeev - who’s about to get into the car.Dolly takes Sanjeev’s hand and makes him pat the dog. The dog  
licks Sanjeev’s hand all over - which grosses him out a bit.
Dolly laughs, as finally Sanjeev gets into the car. And 
drives away.
The Video stays on Dolly for a little while, on her playing 
with the dog. And as it ENDS - 
There’s excitement on Ansari’s face.
ANSARI
Sir yeh photos Conspiracy to murder 
ka case prove karne mein bahot kaam 
aayengi.
Hathi Ram nods - just as excited. His mind racing - He turns to the Forensic Expert.

Par agar itna socha hai saalon ne 
toh address bhi fake hee hoga...
Hathi Ram looks at the sheet in his hands. Something catches his eye.
HATHI RAM
Aapne kaha ek number pe call kiya 
thha. Ye doosra number kya hai?
GRUMPY FORENSIC EXPERT
(peeps in)
Handset ke record mein ek aur 
number pe dial kiya gaya thha, par 
call register hone se pehle hee 
kaat diya, jaise yaad aa gaya ho ki

address hai...
Hathi Ram passes the sheet to Ansari. Something bothers Ansari as he looks at the address, but he’s not sure what.38."
"GRUMPY FORENSIC EXPERT (CONT’D)
Ek cheez aur. Phone mein ek memory

He opens another folder on his desktop.
PHOTOS of a WOMAN. Unclear. Low light.
She’s making playful faces in them. And we can’t really make 
out her face clearly.
Hathi Ram and Ansari start to lose interest. The Expert looks 
at his watch again with impatience. And just then -
A selfie. Where the girl’s trying to hide behind someone . Her 
face is still not fully visible, but that someone is Chaaku.It strikes Ansari.
ANSARI

"Shauki panics. Glances at the kitchen - Where the Wife is.
SHAUKI MAMA
Sir haath jodta hoon aapke...
HATHI RAM
Kyun kahaa tha Tope Singh se koi 
contact nahi?
Shauki puts a hand on his son’s head - who shrugs it away.
SHAUKI MAMA
Sir apne bachche ki kasam khaa ke kehta hoon... maheenon hue, na maine usse baat ki na usne mere se.
HATHI RAM
Kaam ke beech mein se usne ek hee number dial kiya thha. Wo bhi tumhaara...
Shauki looks confused. Ansari takes out a paper.
ANSARI
Six five four five - 
SHAUKI
(realises; completes it)
Two one two, two one two.
Ansari glances at the paper - that’s the number.
SHAUKI (CONT’D)
Us gashti ka hai. Maine hee dilaaya thha. Recharge bhi main hee karwata thha... Par baat usse hoti.
Ansari and Hathi Ram look at each other. *
HATHI RAM

SHAUKI MAMA

hee toh haraamjaadi ne blackmail 
kiya thha...

mouth and takes him away. *
SHAUKI’S WIFE

Chal, neeni ka time ho gaya!
She pulls the boy up by the hand and takes him away as - Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 40."
"SHAUKI’S SON
(defective speech)
Chanda! Gashti! Gashti!
SHAUKI’S WIFE
Kya bolta rehta hai ant shant!
Shauki watches them go with his heart in his mouth. Then 
turns back to Hathi Ram - pleading.
EXT. SHAUKI MAMA’S HOUSE - LANE OUTSIDE - NIGHT 4.42 4.42
Hathi Ram and Ansari walk up to the parked vehicle. Ansari 
has got his phone next to his ear.
A faint AUTOMATED VOICE can be heard coming out of the phone.
ANSARI
Disconnected hai.
Hathi Ram frowns - thinking.
HATHI RAM
Tyagi Chitrakoot se. Chaaku ka 
phone Chitrakoot ka. Ho na ho ye Talreja ka bhi koi connection hoga 
wahaan ka.
He looks at Ansari - grim.
HATHI RAM (CONT’D)
Kal subah headquarter jaana hoga... 
Bhagat sir ko update dene.
Ansari tries to cheer him up.
ANSARI
Sir do lead hain hamaare paas... 
Talreja. Aur ye Chanda. Chaaku ki bandi thhi, saath business karne 
waale thhe... Kuchh toh pata hoga 
ise...
Hathi Ram’s phone rings. He checks. It’s Virk.
HATHI RAM
(answering the phone)
Haan Sir.
He listens on. It’s a very short conversation.
Hathi Ram cuts the phone and looks at Ansari - a little 
confused.
HATHI RAM (CONT’D)
Ye Virk is waqt thaane kyun bula raha hai?41."
"EXT. JAMUNA PAAR POLICE STATION - LANE OUTSIDE + MOVING 4.43 4.43
VEHICLE - NIGHT
Ansari drives. The police Sumo takes a turn in the lane.HATHI RAM’S POV:
The police station - just a few hundred meters away. And then 
he notices something else -
An OB Van outside it.And then - another one, trying to find a spot to pull over.ON THE ROAD:
Commotion. REPORTERS. CAMERAMEN - some already talking to 
their camera, some scrambling to take positions.
Hathi Ram’s heart is in his mouth as Ansari pulls over 
outside the police station.
Hathi Ram gets down. Looks around - what’s going on here?
His eyes go to - A HINDI JOURNALIST speaking to the camera.
HINDI JOURNALIST
Aapne ye suna hoga ki jise aaropi 
samajh ke pakda gaya wo beqasoor 
nikla. Par kya aapne kabhi ye suna 
hai ki jise aurat samajh ke pakda 
wo mard nikla. Jee haan, ye 
sansanikhej kaarnaama Dilli police 
ke Outer Jamuna Paar thaane mein...
From the corner of his hawk-like eyes, the Journalist spots 
Hathi Ram. Dropping his piece mid-way, he makes a dash towards Hathi Ram protruding his microphone -
HINDI JOURNALIST (CONT’D)
Hamaare saath is waqt maujood hain 
case ke Investigating Officer -
Hathi Ram turns around and rushes inside, while Ansari quickly steps forward and blocks the journalist’s path.

"Hathi Ram rushes in. All heads turn to him - Manju, the other 
constables. Everyone.
Hathi Ram straight away rushes towards - 
INT. JAMUNA PAAR POLICE STATION - SHO’S CABIN - NIGHT 4.45 4.45
A sullen DCP Bhagat stands with Virk. *
Hathi Ram just about remembers to salute Bhagat. And then 
throws a quick angry glance at Virk.
HATHI RAM
Sir kisi ne jaan boojh ke yeh khabar leak ki hai media ko... 
Bhagat just stares at him.
HATHI RAM (CONT’D)
Koi try kar raha hai case ko... leads bandh ho rahe hain... Seelampur mein aaj dead body mili hai us Tariq ki...
Bhagat shakes his head in disappointment. Then turns to look at - the other end of the room.
Hathi Ram follows his gaze to see - THREE OFFICERS in smart civvies, including the lady boss *
DWIVEDI and SUNIL GAUTAM are talking to Officer Dahiya.
DCP BHAGAT *
CBI humse ye case take over kar 
raha hai, Chaudhari.
(beat)
Thanks to your fuck up.
The men fix Hathi Ram with a gaze.
Hathi Ram doesn't know what to say. Blabbers -
HATHI RAM
Par sir... ye jo bhi hai... sir 
isse investigation mein koi bhi gadbad nahi hui -
DCP BHAGAT *
Aur haan, Commissioner saab ka *
order hai. You’re suspended.
And he storms out of there - followed by the CBI officers.
Hathi Ram stands there - looking like someone punched him in 
the gut.
Virk puts a sympathetic hand on his shoulder.Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 43."
"Anger rises on Hathi Ram’s face. All of a sudden - he grabs 
Virk by the collar.
HATHI RAM
Ek din maanga thha tere se, *
maadarchod... *
Virk takes a moment to recover. Then pushes him back hard.
SHO VIRK
(pissed)
Toh tere chutiyaapon ke liye main apni naukri gawaaun?
Hathi Ram stares at him for a few moments. Then turns around and walks out. Like a zombie.
INT/EXT. JAMUNA PAAR POLICE STATION - NIGHT 4.46 4.46
The police station. All eyes are on him.
Ansari tries to come forward but then stops himself.Hathi Ram walks up to the ‘MOHRAR’ desk in a daze.He removes his gun from the holster. Then puts down the 
Police-car keys. Their jangling sound is loud and enhanced.
As he drags himself out of the station - journalists start 
throwing QUESTIONS at him. Their voices have a disturbing, hollow echo about them.
Hathi Ram just stands there, staring at everyone and no one 
in particular.
From far a camera flash BURNS his eyesight. And everything goes WHITE...  
FADE OUT
