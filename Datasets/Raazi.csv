"FADE IN:
INT. PAK ARMY HQ - SITUATION ROOM - EVENING 1
Title Card: February 1971. Pakistan.
A series of pictures, black-and-white, low exposure but 
clearly outlining two figures and faces that are in deep 
conversation are seen on an old fashioned projector screen. 
Uniformed top brass from all the defense services (Army, Navy 
and Air Force) and Pakistan’s Intelligence sit around a 
table, being briefed by BRIGADIER SYED (57), tall hard-eyed 
with a striking military bearing in his uniform.  The meeting 
is already in session. Syed clicks a button to zoom in on one 
of the men in the projected photograph.
SYED
Bangaal mein aazaadi ki tehreek zor 
pakad rahi hai. Vahaan Awami League 
ki khufiya Military Council ke 
rehnuma ye shakhs hain – Colonel 
Usmani.
Lt. GENERAL AMIR BEIG (68), grey-haired with cold eyes looks 
at the image.
BEIG
Election bhi jeet chuke hain. Inki 
neeyat kya hai?
The other senior leaders at the table murmur similarly.
SYED
Mujibur Rahman ne apne  saath kuchh 
aise log jama kar liye hain, jo ab 
apne-aap ko Mukti fauj kehlate 
hain...
(looks around)
Mukti - aazaadi..
Sniggers around the room. Syed clicks for the picture to zoom 
in to the other face, only partially seen.
SYED (CONT’D)
Aur ye shakhs hai Khalid Mir... 
Iski padtaal rakhna bahaut zaroori 
hai. Ye Hindustan ke Intelligence 
ke bade afsar hain...
Murmurs around the room. Lt. General Beig looks taken aback.
BEIG
Usmani aur Mujibur Rehman Hindustan 
se baat kar rahe hain? 
Syed nods."
"SYED
Hamein mautbar zariye se maaloom 
hua hai ke Hindustani vazir-e-azam   
bhi Bangaal ko leke koi program 
bana rahi hain... 
BEIG
(cuts in)
Lekin unke paron se hava nikalna 
humein bhi aata hai! Khaariaan se 2 
Infantry Divisions ko Bangaal 
ravaana karne ki soch rahe hain.
Everyone looks interested. On the grainy image of Mir on the 
projection.
CUT TO:
EXT. STREETS OF RAWALPINDI - EVENING 2
A black sedan car drives through the streets of Rawalpindi, 
passing interesting visuals, distinctive shops. Seated inside 
is HIDAYAT KHAN (51), thoughtful and pensive.
CUT TO:
EXT. MAIN BAZAAR - EVENING 3
The car stops in a market place. NAFISA (45), attractive with 
world-weary eyes, standing at the cashier counter nods her 
head in acknowledgement. Hidayat reciprocates and moves into 
to shop. He's greeted by SARVAR (50), wise-eyed, salt-and-
pepper hair, dressed in local attire, who greets Hidayat 
warmly.
HIDAYAT
Salaamalekum! Ek kilo sohan halva 
chahiye Sarvar bhai...
SARVAR
Ji sarkar – ek carton abhi abhi 
aaya hai Multan se...
Hidayat watches as Sarvar packs up the box.
HIDAYAT
Iss baar hum apni beti ko bhi 
chakhaane vaale hain...
Hidayat coughs slightly. Sarvar nods to Hidayat as he hands 
the box to him. Hidayat pays up and leaves.
CUT TO:2."
"EXT. PAK ARMY HQ - EVENING 4
Hidayat's car is seen entering the gates of the Army HQ.
CUT TO:
INT. PAK ARMY HQ - EVENING 5
A cough escapes Hidayat despite his effort to control it. He 
holds his side, waiting for the spasm to pass. A young 
SOLDIER looks at Hidayat.
SOLDIER
Kuchh laaun janaab? Brigadier Sahab 
nikalte hi honge...
Hidayat shakes his head in the negative, smiling with effort.  
As if on cue, an inner door opens and Syed marches out. The 
Soldier, and others around, immediately stand to attention.  
Syed barely notices them, moving to Hidayat, smiling with 
warmth.
SYED
Aah yaar mera! Khushaamdeed!
Hidayat gets to his feet and returns Syed's embrace as he 
sputters into another bout of coughing.
SYED (CONT’D)
Kya baat hai? Tabiyat kuchh naasaaz 
lagti hai...
The two men move to the door.
HIDAYAT
Ho jaaegi... Theek ho jaaegi...
The moment, they are alone, Hidayat turns to Syed.
HIDAYAT (CONT’D)
Aap sunaayein... sab khairiyat hai 
na?
CUT TO:
INT. PAK ARMY HQ - CORRIDOR - EVENING 5A
As they walk down the corridor, Syed looks to ensure there is 
no one around. Offering laung to Hidayat from a dibbi, Syed 
says in a low voice -
SYED
Hidayat... hamaare beherya afsar 
Rusul Amin par tumhari pichhli 
khabar bilkul sahi nikli. 
(MORE)3."
"Woh gaddar Pakistani navy chhodkar 
Mukti fauj se ja juda hai.
Hidayat simply nods in acknowledgement. As Syed leans closer 
and says -
SYED (CONT’D)
Apne mukhbir se kuchh aur 
information nikalva ke do...
HIDAYAT
Kis baare mein?
SYED
Hindustan Mujibur Rehman ki madad 
kar raha hai... uski azaadi ki 
hasrat poori karne ke liye...
Hidayat looks surprised.
SYED (CONT’D)
Unka plan kya hai... pata lagaana 
hai...
HIDAYAT
Hmmm...
SYED
Agar India ne hamare androoni 
maamlaat mein dakhal diya... toh ye 
dakhalandaazi bahaut mehengi padegi 
unhe...
Hidayat nods.
HIDAYAT
Main badi ehtiyaat se iski khabar 
nikalunga aur aapko ittala kar 
doonga...
SYED
Vaise, iska ek pehlu aur bhi hai 
Hidayat... personal... ke aisi koi 
information agar main hasil kar 
loon, toh mera next Major General 
hona kisi hadd tak yakini ho 
jaaega!
HIDAYAT
Inshallah, aisa hi hoga Syed 
bhai... Main aaj hi Kashmir vaapas 
jaa raha hoon... pahonchte hi 
khabar nikaalna shuru kar doonga...
(then)
Aur haan... agle jumme kuchh aur 
khacchar sarhad paar karenge, uss 
mein aapka Kashmiri gaaleecha... SYED (CONT'D)
(MORE)4."
"aur zafran... Inshallah, voh bhi aa 
jaaega!
Syed smiles, pleased.
SYED
Navaazish aapki! Allahtaala taufeeq 
de aapko... aapke business mein 
taraqqi de... aur hamaari paaq 
dosti bani rahe. Pakistan se aapka 
bhaichaara qaayam rahe!
HIDAYAT
Hamesha Syed bhai! Badkismati se 
hamaari sarhad ki lakeerein vahaan 
nahin hain, jahan kheenchi jaani 
chahiye theen... 
SYED
Voh bhi badal jaaenge. Aur bachpan 
ki tarah, hamaare ghar ke aangan 
phir jud jaaenge, Inshallah!
Hidayat looks thoughtful at Syed's cryptic but confident 
words.
CUT TO:
EXT. PAK ARMY HQ - COMPOUND - EVENING 5B
Syed and Hidayat step out into the compound and walk towards  
Hidayat's waiting car.
SYED
Ab hamaare laaik koi khidmat ho to 
bataaein. 
Something makes Hidayat come to a decision. He turns to Syed 
as they reach the car and stand by it. The DRIVER is standing 
a small distance away, at attention.
HIDAYAT
Syed bhai... Ek khwaaish hai... jo 
guzaarish bhi ho sakti hai...
Hidayat coughs a little again as he says this. Syed looks at 
Hidayat with concern and perplexity.
HIDAYAT (CONT’D)
Yun hai... mere lung mein tumour 
mila hai... cigarette vigrette toh 
kabhi pi nahin...
(laughs)
Shaayad zindagi ke kash kuchh lambe 
le liye...HIDAYAT (CONT'D)5."
"Syed places a hand on Hidayat's arm, clearly affected by the 
news.
SYED
Main doctor toh nahin... ek dost ki 
haisiyat se kisi kaam aa sakun to 
kahein...
Hidayat looks at Syed, a small smile on his face.
HIDAYAT
(draws a breath)
Jis tarah mere kandhey par haath 
rakha hai... main chahta hoon meri 
beti Sehmat ke sar pe haath rakh 
dein... Aur apne chhote bete Iqbal 
ke liye, apni panaah mein le lein 
usey... 
CUT TO:
EXT. STREETS LEADING TO PAK BORDER - NIGHT 6
The car zooms through the liquid streets with the moon 
beaming blue.
CUT TO:
INT/EXT. HIDAYAT'S CAR - NIGHT 7
Hidayat sits in the back seat, looking out as the car zooms 
through the dark roads. His words to Syed play back in his 
head.
HIDAYAT   (O.S.)
Badi paaq rooh hai Sehmat... Jis 
ghar mein hogi, uss ghar ki aabroo 
ban jaaegi. 
CUT TO:
EXT. PAK ARMY HQ - COMPOUND - EVENING 8
Syed looks at Hidayat, stricken by his words and the offer.
HIDAYAT
Jaanta hoon, mere har ek lafz mein 
baap ka laad goonjta hai... lekin 
Sehmat ke baare mein kahi meri har 
baat aap sacch paaenge...
Syed smiles with the understanding of a father. Hidayat takes 
Syed’s hands in his.6."
"HIDAYAT (CONT’D)

INT/EXT. HIDAYAT’S CAR - INDIAN BORDER AREA - DAWN 9
The car drives through a mountainous countryside as a border 
post appears in the distance.
HIDAYAT  (O.S.)
...mera sabse bada fakhr meri 
Sehmat hai!
A strange smile skews his handsome face. Hidayat’s driver 
presents the documents to the guard at the border post. 
Hidayat gets out of the car and crosses over to the Indian 
side. At a distance another car awaits him. He gets in and 
drives away into the breaking dawn.
CUT TO:
EXT. HIDAYAT'S HOME - AFTERNOON 10
Title Card: February, 1971. Srinagar, India.
A nondescript car is parked in the compound of a beautiful 
bungalow.  Beside it is the black car that Hidayat had 
traveled in from Pakistan.
MIR   (O.S.)
Main kya kahoon Hidayat... Ajeeb 
baat kar di tumne...
CUT TO:
INT. HIDAYAT’S HOME - LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON 10A
KHALID MIR (45), statuesque and imposing in his demeanor, 
looks at Hidayat in disbelief.
Standing by Mir is MAJOR NIKHIL BAKSHI (24), a silent, junior 
observer. SAIRA, the helper, is setting up tea on the large 
centre table in the room.
Hidayat - dressed in Kashmiri attire - an exquisite shawl 
covering his shoulders, coughing intermittently, looks 
resolute even as Mir reacts in shock.
Mir shakes his head in a firm negative.7."
"MIR
India ke liye suraag lagaana, uske 
liye Pakistan mein contacts banaaye 
rakhna, aur baat hai. Lekin ek 
masoom ladki ko, jisey jaasoosi ka 
ilm bhi nahin... usey ek Pakistani 
Brigadier ke ghar me byahna...
(shakes his head again)
Beti hai tumhaari Hidayat!
HIDAYAT
Ek Hindustani pehle hai...
Mir looks at him in silent awe as Hidayat adds -
HIDAYAT (CONT’D)
Aap nahin jaante ye vaqt Hindustan 
ke liye kitna aham hai... aur kitna 
khatarnaak ho sakta. 
Mir looks alarmed.
HIDAYAT (CONT’D)
Bangaal mein Hindustan ki 
madaakhalat ki bhanak padh chuki 
hai unhe. Aur vo usey bardaasht 
nahin karenge. Pakistan ko tootne 
nahin denge. Hamaare khilaaf vo koi 
badi scheme taiyaar kar rahe hain.
MIR
Kaisi scheme?
He coughs severely, then composes himself.
HIDAYAT
Mir Sahab, ye maloom ho jaata to 
apni beti ki jaan kyun daav par 
lagata? Meri beemari ne mujhe 
majboor kar diya hai ki main iss 
mission ko uske anjaam tak nahin 
pahoncha paaunga... Aur un logon ka 
jo yaqeen mujh par hai, voh mere 
elaava sirf meri beti par ho sakta 
hai.  
MIR
Lekin agar...
Just then, TEJI (45) - an elegantly dressed, beautiful woman 
enters the room with refreshments. Mir goes silent. Teji 
looks at Mir and smiles, clearly unaware of what her husband 
plans.
TEJI
Aap khaana kha kar jaaenge na Mir 
bhai? 8."
"Mir smiles apologetically.
MIR
Iss baar nahin bhabhi... Dilli mein 
bureau ki ek zaroori meeting hai. 
Bas niklunga.
TEJI
Phir mewa bhijvati hoon. 
(to Hidayat)
Khilaakar bhejiyega. Khaali pet 
iraade nahin bharte!
Hidayat nods. Teji leaves, smiling.
MIR
Teji ka kya khayaal hai?
HIDAYAT
Voh to chahti hai khana khaake 
jaaein...
Mir darts an impatient look at Hidayat. He is quiet for a 
moment and then asks –
MIR
Aur Sehmat se poochha tumne?
HIDAYAT
Humse kya poochha tha walid sahab 
ne? Bas bata diya tha... aur sikha 
diya tha.
MIR
Tumne bataaya beti ko? Ki uski 
kismat mein kya likh rahe ho?
Hidayat is silent for a moment before he speaks –
HIDAYAT
Bataaunga. Bataunga main... aur 
sikhaenge aap. Mauqa denge usey, to 
khud hi dekh lenge. Tez dimaag aur 
nadar mann hai uska. Jo main 
mukammal nahin kar sakunga, voh 
Sehmat karegi.
There's fierce pride in Hidayat's voice and eyes as he 
speaks. Mir looks at Hidayat, clearly affected by his words.
HIDAYAT (CONT’D)
Tumhe bhi vahi keh raha hoon, jo 
Brigadier Syed se kaha hai...
Hidayat smiles.9."
"HIDAYAT (CONT’D)
Meri zindagi ka sab se bada fakhr 
hai, Sehmat.
Mir looks thoughtful. Nikhil Bakshi watches the two men, 
stricken by what he's hearing.
CUT TO:
EXT. INS VIKRAMADITYA - ARABIAN SEA - DAY 11
Title Card: December 2017.
NIKHIL BAKSHI (71), a Lt. General now, older but his features 
still recognisable as the young officer of back then, looks 
down from the make-shift podium on the aircraft carrier’s 
deck, as he speaks to the young men standing before him – 
eager young officers with a rare pride on their faces. Also 
among the listeners are colleagues from the Army, Air Force 
and Navy, senior and junior both. The ship’s deck has been 
decorated for a celebration.
BAKSHI
Chhayaalis saal hue... hamaari 
teenon faujon ne mil kar Pakistan 
ke khilaaf sann ikkhattar (71) ki 
jung jeeti thi. Aur Pakistan ka ek 
tukda alag kar diya tha.
A cheer goes around the audience. The young officers listen 
in rapt attention as Bakshi orates–
BAKSHI (CONT’D)
(looks around)
Main bahaut se naye young officers 
dekh raha hoon, jo uss vaqt paida 
bhi nain hue thay. Aur kuchh 
seniors abhi god mein thay!
Bakshi smiles nostalgically as a shadow of reminiscence 
crosses his face.
BAKSHI (CONT’D)
Jin senior officers ne voh jung 
dekhi hai, vo uss vaqt ki 
qurbaaniyaan bhool nahin sakte.
Senior defense people nod, eyes reflecting their memories.10."
"BAKSHI (CONT’D)
Sirf vahi nahin jo jung mein ladey 
thay... balki voh bhi jo front se 
door apni jaan par khel kar hamaare 
faujon ki madad kar rahe thay - 
hamaare Intelligence bureau ke 
diler agents! Unke bemisaal 
kaarnaamein ab bhi yaad aate

ladki bhi...
A couple of young officers standing by a Colonel, look at 
each other.
YOUNG CADET 1
Bees saal ki ladki... hamaari 
intelligence mein?
YOUNG CADET 2
Possible ho sakta hai kya? Ainvayi! 
Koi kahaani ban gayi hogi...
The Colonel turns to the youngsters, eyes hooded, voice 
impassive.
COLONEL
Bahaut si aisi kahaniyaan sunne ko 
milengi training ke dauran... 
stories that will make soldiers out 
of you all. Kuchh man-ghadant 
hongi, kuchh fun-ghadant bhi hongi.

Aur kuchh aisi real hongi ke sunkar 
chaunk jaaoge – ki aisa bhi hua

EXT. DELHI UNIVERSITY GROUNDS - EVENING 12
Title Card: January 1971, New Delhi.
Lush green lawns of Delhi University. Students dot the 
campus. A pair of bare feet are seen walking in the grass. A 
bunch of squirrels are feasting on some peanuts.
A baby squirrel is seen chasing a peanut onto a sidewalk. It 
scrambles onto the road outside and freezes in fear as a 
scooter zips by.
A pair of eyes turns to see the squirrel.
SEHMAT - 20-year-old, strikingly pretty, rushes to the 
squirrel and manages to pick it up before it can scurry 
further into the road. Still kneeling on the road, she checks 
the baby to see if it's hurt, then spots the peanut it was 
chasing that's close by. 11."
"She moves to pick up the peanut, completely unmindful of the 
car that is seen speedily approaching her in the background.
MITALI (O.S.)
Sehmat!
MITALI, a pretty 21-year old girl rushes towards her and 
shoves her off the road, seconds before the oncoming car 
drives by.
They tumble onto the sidewalk.
MITALI (CONT’D)
Dhyaan kahan hai tera, bewakoof?!
Sehmat, still holding gently onto the baby squirrel, 
disguises her own trepidation at what just happened.
SEHMAT
(smiles)
Gilhari par.
Sehmat places the squirrel back onto the lawn, where it 
scurries away to its family.
As Sehmat gets to her feet, a searing pain arrests her steps. 
Mitali notices Sehmat's bleeding foot. A shard of glass is 
embedded in her sole.
MITALI
Oh ho!
Sehmat hobbles to a bench nearby and rests her foot on her 
other knee. Sehmat looks away from the bleeding wound.
SEHMAT
Tu nikaal... Mujhe toh khoon dekh 
ke chakkar aa raha hai...
MITALI
(rolling her eyes)
Darpok!
Mitali tries, but even she's unable to face all the blood.

Sehmat hops on one leg, holding onto Mitali's shoulder for 
support as they move down the corridor.
MITALI

Sehmat looks alarmed.12."
"SEHMAT
Sui nahin baba!
MITALI
Uss kaanch ke tukde se toh kam

Mitali stops near the guard’s desk in the corridor and 
reaches out for the telephone diary.

The guard at the desk is startled. Mitali smiles -

Pata nahin? College ki telephone

Sehmat smiles nonchalantly as Mitali moves to the phone to 
dial.

A Hostel helper comes looking for Sehmat.
MAID
Sehmat... Miss Sehmat Khan! Phone

Sehmat reacts and turns to Mitali. Mitali nods at her, 
telling her to not get alarmed. They hurry into the hostel 
with the Maid.
CUT TO:
INT. HOSTEL ROOM - EVENING 15
Sehmat is packing her bag in a panic as Mitali is helping 
out, yet trying to keep her calm. She softly straightens the 
crease between Sehmat’s eyebrows.13."
"MITALI
Itni chunnat mat dal maathe pe... 
Aisi koi fikr ki baat hoti toh vo 
bata dete..
SEHMAT
Nahin bataya, isiliye toh darr rahi 
hoon... Iss tarah fauran aane ke 
liye kaha... 
Mitali smiles at her as she picks up her packed bag.
MITALI
Fatafat. Fauran. Buzurgon ki aadat 
hoti hai. Chal... sab sahi hoga.
Sehmat draws a deep breath as the girls get out of the room 
and walk down the hostel corridor.

Teji puts her cup down, looking at Hidayat, chiding. They are

HIDAYAT

(after a pause)
Dekhte hain...
TEJI
Aur tum bhi ab bata rahe ho... ke 
kal pahonchegi! Navratron ke din

Non-veg kaise banaungi uske liye?!
Teji is on her feet and walking straightening her clothes,. 
She calls out -
TEJI (CONT’D)
Saira! Hamid se kaho gaadi nikale. 
Dukaane bandh hone mein abhi vaqt 
hai. Aur kal ke liye rajma bhigo

Baith jao, Teji...
TEJI
Bas baazaar hoke aati hoon... Usey 
mojriyaan bhi chahiye theen...

Something about his voice makes Teji react.
TEJI
Voh theek toh hai na?

Sehmat is seen rushing through the crowd. Her face breaks 
into a smile as her eyes find Hidayat waiting towards the 
entrance of the bus stand. She reaches him and he hugs her 
tight, as she exclaims in releif –
SEHMAT

Hidayat smiles.

Hidayat smiles faintly. Teji moves to the door.
TEJI

Hidayat steps in.
HIDAYAT
Haan... Chalo kuchh kha lein... 
SEHMAT

jaana hota hai, uss mein hamaare 
Intelligence Bureau ke liye main jo 
kaam karta hoon, tum jaanti ho...
Sehmat nods.
HIDAYAT (CONT’D)
Iss baar jo main uss taraf gaya,

Hindustan par mandlata nazar

Sehmat looks alarmed.
SEHMAT
War? Phir se?16."
"HIDAYAT
Jung ke haalaat toh Bangaal mein ho 
rahe hain... Aur Hindustan usme 
shaamil na ho, isiliye Pakistan 
aisa kuchh karna chahta hai, ke 
Hindustan ko apaahij kar de!
SEHMAT
Aisa kya kar sakte hain voh?
Hidayat is silent for a beat. Then,
HIDAYAT
Pata nahin. Ye saara maamla kuchh 
mahinon ka lagta hai... aur mere 
paas kuchh mahine bache nahin

Sehmat looks stricken. She sits by her father and takes his 
hand. She looks at her mother.
SEHMAT
Maa?
Teji is trying hard to hold her tears.
TEJI
Mujhe inhone kal raat bataaya, jo 
ye 4 mahine se jaante thay - 
(her tone hardens)
Inke lung mein tumor hai. Aur vo 
badh raha hai. Lekin apni biwi ko 
iss kaabil nahin samjha ke vo share 
kar sakey... khayaal kar sakey...
Sehmat’s tears stream her face. Her voice is choked.
SEHMAT
Aapne pehle kyun nahin bataaya 
Abba? Main aapke paas aa jaati...
HIDAYAT
Isiliye toh ab bulaaya tumhe...
Teji looks away as she says -
TEJI
Nahin... isiliye nahin bulaaya...
Sehmat looks taken aback. Hidayat looks feebly at Teji. Takes 
a deep breath before he explains -  
HIDAYAT
Sehmat beta... Hamaara kisi bhi 
aafat ke liye taiyaar rehna zaroori 
hai. Main chahta hoon tum meri 
jagah le lo. Hindustan ki aankh aur 
kan ban kar Pakistan mein raho.17."
"TEJI
(snaps in)
Kis tarah... ye bhi bataao.
HIDAYAT
Bata raha hoon Teji... Sab bata 
raha hoon.
He take a gulp of water from the glass lying near by. Hidayat 
remains silent for a few moments. He looks at Teji, then 
speaks - his words sharp, intense, measured.
HIDAYAT (CONT’D)
Pakistan mein mere waaqif, 
Brigadier Syed...
TEJI
(cuts in)
Vo unse mil chuki hai... aapke 
store mein aaya karte thay.
Sehmat, wrapped in suspense, only nods.
HIDAYAT
Hukumat ke high circles mein bhi 
unka bahaut rasookh hai. Aur iss 
kaam ke liye vahan tak pahonchne ka 
iss se behtar rasta mujhe nazar 
nahin aaya.

her.
CUT TO BLACK:

A light is switched on. Sehmat is lying on her bed playing 
with the lamp switch, turning the light on and off. Her 
father’s words ring in her ears.
HIDAYAT (O.S.)
Bureau se go-ahead mil gaya hai. Ab 
faisla hum par hai.
Sehmat’s eyes are staunch. Focused.
Just then, there's a knock on her door. The door opens and 
Hidayat steps in. He looks distraught. 
HIDAYAT (CONT’D)
Tum kal subah college laut jao 
beta.18."
"Sehmat looks confused as she sits up. Hidayat walks up to 
her, his eyes are bloodshot.
HIDAYAT (CONT’D)
Pata nahin kya soch raha tha 
main... tumhein iss khatre mein 
daalne ka khayaal bhi kaise aaya 
mujhe... 
Her father’s guilt overwhelms Sehmat.
SEHMAT
Abbu, aap khud ko mulq ke liye 
khatre mein kyun daalte hain?
HIDAYAT
Vo mere abbu ki ravaayat thi. Jo 
hamse kaha gaya, jaise sikhaya 
gaya, humne kiya. Lekin tumse vahi 
karana, galati hai.
Sehmat is silent for a moment. As Hidayat is about to speak 
up again, Sehmat says -
SEHMAT
Theek hai Abbu, aap kehte hain to 
main college laut jaati hoon.
(pauses)
Lekin mere abbu ne bhi vahi taleem 
mujhe di hai... ke watan ke aage 
kuchh nahin. Khud bhi nahin. 
Semat looks intently at her father as she says -
SEHMAT (CONT’D)
Aur agar voh galati hai, toh phir
desh ki hifaazat ke liye beton ko 
fauj mein daalna bhi galati hai.
Hidayat is taken aback. Sehmat just smiles and takes her 
father’s face in his hands. She kisses his forehead.
CUT TO:
EXT. HIDAYAT’S HOME - GARDEN - DAY 21
Mir walks into the garden towards where Teji and Hidayat are 
seated. Sehmat approaches the seating area. Mir greets 
Hidayat, Teji, and kisses Sehmat on the head, clearly fond of 
her. Hidayat nods at Mir, indicating Sehmat has been told.
Mir looks at Sehmat, then at Teji.
MIR
Teji ji?19."
"Teji mechanically begins to pour tea for everyone, her voice 
chokes as she says – 
TEJI
Ji bhai saab. Humne hamaari iklauti 
beti ko bata diya hai ke hum usey 
dushman ke ghar byaah rahe hain... 
Sehmat takes the teapot from Teji and continues to make the 
tea. 
TEJI (CONT’D)
Aur uss se yeh bhi keh diya hai ke 
Pakistan mein rehke, Hindustan ki 
jaasoosi karo, bina kisi ko shak  
hue. Apne shauhar ko bhi nahin. 
Mir looks at her, silent, blank.
TEJI (CONT’D)
Kyunki agar kisi ko pata chal gaya 
toh voh... voh kya karenge meri 
beti ka... bas yeh hi nahin bata 
paaye Mir bhai! Kya karenge uska? 
Aap bataiye!
Teji breaks into sobs. Hidayat places a hand on hers to 
console her. Mir speaks solemnly.
MIR
Main aapka khauff samajh sakta hoon 
bhabhi. Lekin Sehmat akeli nahin 
hogi vahaan par. Vahaan hamaari 
ground team usko poori tarah se 
support degi. Aur hamaara sara 
system uss par nazar rakhega. Uske 
ek ishaare par ussey vahan se 
nikaal liya jaaega.
Teji doesn’t seem convinced, still sobbing. Mir turns to 
Hidayat.
HIDAYAT
Teji, manzar itna khauffnak nahin 
hai, jitna tum dekh rahi ho... Main 
bhi toh yahi karta tha...
TEJI
Toh Sehmat bhi vahi kare... tumhara 
karobar dekhe! Uske liye Syed ke 
ghar mein byaahne ki kya zaroorat 
hai?
Before Hidayat or Mir can reply, Sehmat speaks.
SEHMAT
Bahu isiliye, kyunki Abbu ke paas 
waqt nahin hai...20."
"Mir looks at Sehmat, impressed by her clarity. He glances at 
Hidayat, who looks at him, as if to say 'I told you so'.
MIR
Sehmat... soch lo... tumhein bahaut 
kuchh qurbaan karna padega iske 
liye... 
Sehmat looks at Hidayat and Mir, and her mother across her.
SEHMAT
Sab qurbaan ho sakta hai... Watan 
nahin...
Hidayat looks at Sehmat, burdened. Teji is a picture of 
desolation.

Sehmat is seated in Hidayat’s chair in the study. Hidayat 
stands behind her, near the window. Mir leans on the desk as 
he speaks, his voice low and foreboding.
MIR
Tumhaara rishta Pakistan mein kyun 
hua, ye sirf hum jaante hain 
Sehmat. Toh saheliyon ko bataane ke 
liye, koi munaasib kahaani soch

"INT. TRAINING BASE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 23
Thick wooden doors swing open and Mir enters the conference 
room, with Bakshi a step behind. Sehmat looks up and gets to 
her feet. 
MIR
Good morning.
Mir nods to her to sit. He takes a seat across her. Bakshi 
keeps standing.
MIR (CONT’D)
Ye Nikhil Bakshi hain. Ye aapki 
training mein hamesha aapke saath 
rahenge.
(To Nikhil)
Aur aap, Sehmat Khan. 
Sehmat nods slightly in acknowledgment. Mir continues 
impersonally, a sharp contrast from his demeanor back at 
Hidayat’s home.
MIR (CONT’D)
Training se pehle kuchh zaroori 
instructions aapko bata di jaaen: 
Sabse pehle toh ye ki as a field 
agent, aapke gird ek lakshman-rekha 
kheench di jaaegi – jiske baahar 
khatra hai. Aapke saare action usi 
rekha ke andar honge. Aur apni 
marzi se koi action nahin lengi 
aap. Kyunki apka kaam sirf relay 
race ka kaam hai - jo khabar aapko 
haasil ho, vo aagey pass karte 
rahiye. Aankh aur kaan har vaqt 
khule rahein. Clear?
Sehmat nods.
MIR (CONT’D)
Kabhi kisi mauke par agar aisa lage 
ki tumhaara raaz faash ho raha hai, 
toh samajh lo ki ho chuka hai! Apne 
instincts par bharosa karna. Aur 
hamein ittala karna. Hum fauran 
tumhein nikalne ka raasta saaf kar 
denge.
Sehmat looks at Mir, evenly.
SEHMAT
Aapko lagta hai, main ye kar nahin 
paaungi. Hai na?
Mir meets her eyes, sharp and astute.22."
"MIR
Abhi keh nahin sakta. 
(stands up)
Training shuru karo. Mahine bhar 
baad yahi savaal mujhse dobaara 
poochhna. Tab javaab doonga.
Sehmat is silent. Mir gestures to follow him out of the room. 
CUT TO:
INT. INDIAN INTELLIGENCE BUREAU - SITUATION ROOM - DAY 24
A room with monitors and people around. Sehmat looks around 
as Mir speaks –
MIR
Mukhbari kehte hain isey... 
Surveillance.
At the far end of the room is an island table where different 
kinds of equipment are laid out. Sehmat, Mir and Bakshi stand 
around it. In front of her is a projection screen, beside it 
is a blackboard.
MIR (CONT’D)
Kai tarah se hoti hai. Ek physical - 
kisi pe nazar rakhna... kuchh doori 
se...
Sehmat listens as Mir speaks on. He clicks a screen where an 
image of a man watching someone across the street is seen.  
The man is using a pair of binoculars.
Mir holds up the same pair of binoculars from the table.  
Sehmat looks at it.
MIR (CONT’D)
Remote surveillance mein doori badh 
jaati hai. Aur nazar rakhne ke 
bajaaye kaan lagate hain. Bugs... 
An image of bugs in a room and someone listening with 
headphones is seen.
Mir picks up a headphone from the table.
MIR (CONT’D)
Magar har haal mein apne chaugirde 
se chaukanna rehna zaroori hai. 
Sehmat listens, focussed. Standing by her side, Mir tosses 
the headphone at her. It catches Sehmat at the side of her 
head. She exclaims in pain.23."
"MIR (CONT’D)
Yahi bata raha tha... chaugirdey se 
chaukanna rehna hai... ki do aankh 
saamne, do kandhon par aur aur ek 
guddi par...

her head)
Yahaan... hamesha khuli rehni

Sehmat looks at him, rubbing her head.
CUT TO:
INT. TRAINING BASE - LECTURE ROOM - DAY 25
Mir is sitting across Sehmat on a study table. Nikhil Bakshi 
is sitting at another desk alongside. Sehmat - a slight 
bruise on her head where she was hit - has the Morse Code 
equipment in front of her.
MIR
Hum tumhein tabhi contact karenge 
jab tum ishaara dogi. Varna nahin. 
Aur direct communication... 
phone... kabhi nahin. Pakda ja 
sakta hai.
Mir gets up and goes towards the blackboard to write.
MIR (CONT’D)
Jo bhi information aayegi, Morse ke 
zariye se. Unit install karne ke 
baad, test message bhejna, taaki 
hamein ittalla ho jaaye.
The blackboard says 'Morse Code'. Mir taps - a sheet in front 
of her has the Morse symbols for each alphabet.
MIR (CONT’D)
Ek ek alphabet ka ek ek sign 
tumhein zabaani yaad karna hoga.
Mir writes 'Danger' on the blackboard. Bakshi steps forward 
to demonstrate the tapping on the morse unit.
BAKSHI
Dots ke liye halka tap, dash ke 
liye thoda lamba tap kariye...
Sehmat begins to painstakingly tap the code. She makes a 
mistake, shakes her head. The timer says 5 minutes. Bakshi 
looks at Mir.

Sehmat is on the training ground, running. It's not even dawn

sidelines. Yawning. 
Sehmat is almost breathless, Mir isn't even breaking a sweat.
CUT TO:
INT. TRAINING BASE - LECTURE ROOM - NIGHT 31
A ladies vanity case lies open on the desk. It has listening 
devices, wires etc in it, along with cosmetics and 
toiletries. Sehmat is still tapping on the Morse Code 
machine. Still making mistakes.
CUT TO:
INT. TRAINING BASE - LECTURE ROOM - DAY 32
The tables and chairs have been moved to one side. Sehmat is 
being taught self-defense techniques. Mir is watching 
intently as she is being taught how to hit at someone who 
comes at her from behind or her blind side.
At one point, she is thrown on the floor by her trainer. Mir 
comes to her as she is picking herself up. 
MIR
(putting a smile on her 
lips with his fingers)
Chaahe jo bhi ho raha ho tumhaare 
saath, ek nayi bahu ki muskuraahat

Zyaada muskuraane se gaal dard

grip her. Keeps the smile intact. It's a big and wide smile. 
She massages her cheeks after a bit! Mir hides a grin. 
CUT TO:
INT. TRAINING BASE - SEHMAT’S QUARTERS - TWILIGHT 33
Sehmat is sleeping in her room, exhausted. She reacts to a 
knock on the door. Looks at the watch.  It's 4 a.m.  She 
groans and gets up.
CUT TO:
INT. TRAINING BASE - SHOOTING RANGE - DAY 34
At the shooting range, Sehmat has headphones on as she fires 
her last shot. She begins to reload her pistol. Mir enters 
the range from behind, unknown to Sehmat. As he reaches 
behind her, Mir suddenly flicks the pistol out of Sehmat’s 
hand. Grabbing her by the neck, he spins her and topples her 
to the ground. Caught unaware, hurt and angry, Sehmat throws 
off her headphones and clutches her face.
SEHMAT
(screaming)
Uff! Headphone pehne hue thay!!!
MIR
Headphones sound cancel karte hain, 
nazar nahin. Baaki aankein khuli

Sehmat is tired and beat.
SEHMAT

Itna berehem ki janta hoon, agar ye 
karishma na kar sakin toh iska 
shikaar bhi tum hi hogi. Main 
nahin. Nikhil nahin. Hidayat Khan 
nahin. Sirf tum! 
Mir holds out his hand to her. She doesn’t accept. He grabs 
her arm and yanks her to her feet. Staring right into her 
eyes he says ominously -
MIR (CONT’D)
Ek bhool, ek chook hui aur tumhari 
laash zameen par padi hogi.27."
"He picks up her gun, fallen on the floor. She looks at him, 
angry, upset. 
MIR (CONT’D)

karo. 
He hands her the gun. Sehmat starts shooting - angry, 
humiliated. Mir looks at the target board. Sehmat’s wrath is 
evident on it.
CUT TO:
INT. TRAINING BASE - SEHMAT’S QUARTERS - NIGHT 35
Sehmat sits in on the floor, leaning against the bed. She has 
the phone beside her. She seems to come to a decision, picks 
up the receiver and dials.
SEHMAT
Ek urgent call lagani hai. 
Sirinagar...
OPERATOR   (O.S.)
Number bataiye.
Sehmat opens her mouth to give the number, then closes it.  
She realizes she can't do it, she can't give up.

She hangs up. Her fingers curl to fists by her side.

INT. TRAINING BASE - LECTURE ROOM - DAY 36
Sehmat stands in the lecture room, shoulders squared, her 
chin determined. She is given a list of telephone numbers.

yaadaasht mein gudva do. Kahin kisi 
naam, patey ki galati nahin hogi. 
Jitna vaqt lage, yaad kar lo.
A smile spreads across Sehmat's face as she looks at the 
numbers. She takes the paper in her hand, reads through it 
and hands it back to Mir. He looks surprised.

It is an actual simulation where she has to install 
surveillance equipment in a library. As Sehmat is about to 
slip out, Mir points to a piece that's fallen on the ground.  
Voices are heard outside. Sehmat crouches, makes her way to 
the door, sticks the last piece under the pelmet of the door 
and escapes just as people enter the room. She's done it in 
record time.30."

Sehmat is talking to Bakshi while they walk down the stairs. 
They reach the landing, a bunch of people emerge from a room 
on one side. Among them is Mir. He's in Sehmat's blind spot 
and comes to tackle her from behind.
Sehmat, extremely alert, turns, and grabbing Mir in the exact 
manner that the self-defense trainer displayed, downs Mir to 
the ground and immobilizes him! There's pin drop silence as 
everyone around looks at Mir fallen and Sehmat holding his 
hand in a deadlock. Mir allows himself a smile. This time, 
Sehmat gives out a hand up.
CUT TO:
EXT. TRAINING BASE - GROUNDS - EVENING 42
Sehmat and Mir sit on the stairs, glasses of tea in hand.

Sehmat looks at Mir.
SEHMAT
Ek savaal phir se poochhun aap se?
(after a pause)
Aapko lagta hai main ye kar

He is silent for a beat, then looks at her.
MIR
Yakeen hai.
A tired happy smile spreads across Sehmat's face. 
Mir looks at her, a quizzical expression on his face.

The house is beautifully decorated with flowers and lights 
and streamers. Beautifully dressed people throng the 
landscaped lawns, children run around, music plays via a live 
band and wedding songs are being sung. Hidayat, looking 
weaker, thinner, is overseeing things. Just then, a bunch of 
youngsters come running up to him.

Hidayat hurries towards the gate.

Standing at the window, dressed in bridal finery, henna in 
her hands, Sehmat looks out the window.
POV:
Brigadier Syed gets off the car and meets Hidayat warmly, 
hugging him. He introduces Hidayat to MEHBOOB (32), a good 
looking man with a serious face and military bearing. 32."
"MUNIRA (24), a pretty young woman with smiling eyes stands 
with Mehboob, evidently his wife.  And finally, getting off 
the car - is a tall, well built young man. He greets Hidayat.  
IQBAL (26), a handsome young man with a face that's more like 
an artist's than a soldier's smiles and embraces Hidayat 
warmly.
Hidayat takes from the tray held by a relative standing next 
to him, a peacock feather with a gold thread. He pins it on 
Iqbal's turban.
Sehmat looks at the man who will be her husband.
As if drawn by something, Iqbal looks up the house, towards 
the window that Sehmat is at. Sehmat immediately moves away, 
although she knows he cannot see her. She turns and sees 
Mitali standing beside her.
Mitali tries to tease Sehmat about peeping on her would-be 
husband. But Sehmat's face is a smiling mask.
There's a movement at the door and Teji enters the room.  
She's carrying a small tray.
MITALI
Aaiye aunty... Main abhi aati 
hoon...
Mitali leaves the room, giving mother and daughter some 
privacy. Teji places the tray on the bed and picks up a small 
ornament from it.
TEJI
Ye tumhaari naani ke dehjoor 
hain...
Teji fastens the ear ornament on Sehmat. Sehmat looks into 
the mirror and straightens it. Teji scans Sehmat's face.

own. Then nods and moves to the door.33."
"TEJI
Mitali ko bhejungi bulaane ke liye.
She leaves the room. Suddenly, the music picks up, louder, 
celebratory. Sehmat reacts. She shuts the window. The music 
still is heard, loud and clear. Sehmat's face reveals her 
anxiety. She moves to the bathroom door.

Sehmat is anxious, she looks at her reflection in the mirror 
and tears brim in her eyes. 
There's a knock on the door. Sehmat snaps out of it.

pulls out a piece of tissue, fixes her face. She fixes her 
‘bahu’ smile on her face and moves to the door.

The wedding rituals are conducted. Sehmat is sitting on one 
side of the curtain with her parents, Iqbal on the other with 
his family.
The QAZI places Iqbal's hand in Hidayat's and makes Iqbal 
take the vows.
Sehmat - behind her veil - responds to the Qazi's question.

The curtain between the two is dropped. Sehmat looks at 
Iqbal, and he at her - the veils are still on.

"EXT. HIDAYAT'S HOME - DAY 48
Fresh in a resplendent traditional attire, Sehmat hugs her 
father tight as they stand in the foyer, ready to bid 
goodbye. She does not allow herself to cry. Hidayat kisses 
her head, clasping her hand, unable to let go even as Sehmat 
hugs her mother and looks at Mitali. Tears fall down Teji's 
face, Mitali holds a protective arm around Teji's shoulder.
Hidayat still has Sehmat's hand clasped in his, as Sehmat 
moves to Syed's car and sits. Hidayat looks at Sehmat and 
finally lets go of her hand. Teji hands Hidayat a Quran 
wrapped in gold and green. Hidayat gives Sehmat the Quran. 
She holds it close to her chest.
Syed smiles at Hidayat, touches his shoulder. 
Syed gets into the car. Iqbal gets in on Sehmat's other side.
The cars leave.

There is staff waiting at the Porch. Syed gets off, from his 
car. Sehmat covers her face in her ghoonghat and moves to get 
off, when Iqbal touches her shoulder. She stiffens up. 
Visibly. And Iqbal notices.
IQBAL
Sorry... Zara rukiye.
Sehmat sits back. They wait in the car, while Munira 
organises things with the staff waiting outside. She takes a 
gift-wrapped parcel and an envelope from Salma, the maid 
standing at the porch and moves towards Sehmat’s car.
Munira then taps on the window on Sehmat's side. Sehmat steps 
out of the car, not taking Iqbal's hand. Iqbal doesn't react, 
and stands by Sehmat's side. Munira removes Sehmat’s nazar. 
Sehmat hands Munira the Quran that Hidayat had given her. 
Munira lifts Sehmat’s ghoonghat - 
MUNIRA

Munira hands the gifts to Sehmat. Sehmat smiles at Munira. 
She looks at Syed and Mehboob standing by. She moves to touch 
their feet for their blessings. Syed stops her.
SYED
Hamaare yahaan betiyaan badon ke 
paanv nahin chhootin...36."
"Sehmat nods, hiding her reaction to the words. Syed touches 
her head in blessing, as does Mehboob. Munira leads her 
towards the door. Iqbal follows.

INT. SYED HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 55
The household staff is all lined up, smiling in welcome of 
the new member.
Munira introduces Sehmat to everyone. At the end of the line-
up of the smiling faces is a closed face, that doesn't seem 
too happy about Sehmat. ABDUL (60), clearly a senior helper 
nods at Sehmat, polite but cold.
MUNIRA
Abdul se milo Sehmat... Ghar ke sab 
se puraane mulaazim hain. Iqbal ko 
paal ke bada kiya hai, isliye bade 
possessive hain unke liye. Inke 
haath ki biryani khilaaenge 
aapko...
Sehmat smiles at Abdul, but sees the suspicion and wariness 
in his eyes. She realizes this is someone she needs to keep 
an eye on. Abdul looks beyond Sehmat, at Iqbal and smiles 
warmly at him.
SYED
Sehmat beta, aapka naye ghar, naye 
khaandaan, naye mulk Pakistan mein

Sehmat is sitting on her bed, changed into a delicately 
embroidered salwar kurta. Her head still covered in a 
beautiful odhni. It's a beautiful large room, done up 
elegantly. Apart from the bed and a desk and chair, there's a 
sitting area with a large couch and chairs by a window that 
overlooks the lawn. Sehmat reacts as the bathroom door opens 
and Iqbal steps out. He has changed into a simple kurta 
pyjama for the night. He moves to the other side of the bed 
from where Sehmat is sitting and picks up a pillow.
As he walks away from the bed, Sehmat reacts, alarmed.
SEHMAT
Kahaan ja rahe hain aap?
Iqbal turns to her, grave and serious.37."
"IQBAL
Yahin hoon... sofay pe. Ye beech ka 
darvaza bandh kar doonga aapki 
privacy ke liye...
He gestures to the partition door that divides the room, that 
Sehmat had not noticed. Sehmat is silent, stumped.

Vaalden ne toh laakar mila diya. 
Lekin hum bhi toh sabr se jaan lein

Aur mujhe bhi.
He shuts the partition door between the two areas.  Just as 
he's about to close it completely, Sehmat speaks up.
SEHMAT
Ye thoda sa khula rehene dijiye?
Iqbal doesn't reply, but he leaves the door just a tad ajar.  
Sehmat lays down in bed, looking at the ceiling, her face a 
riot of emotions, trying to make sense of all that's happened 
in the last few weeks.
Just then, music begins to play. It's the saxophone riff of 
Nina Simone's 'I put a spell on you'.
IQBAL   (O.S.)
I hope you don't mind...
SEHMAT
Ji nahin. I don’t.
Sehmat finds herself relaxing with the music. Her eyes close.

proverbial border between the countries they belong to.

puts it into the drawer. 
Sehmat notices carefully as she begins to help Iqbal get 
ready. She hands him his wallet, beret and bag that are lying 
on the bed. Iqbal is as serious as ever, consciously ensuring 
he doesn't touch her even by accident. Sehmat sighs, knowing 
it was her actions.

react. Saadiq realizes this and hurries away to the inside of 
the shop. Sehmat is nonplussed. She's about to speak when she 
senses something and stops. She turns slightly and looks 
towards her blind spot. The Orderly is walking towards her. 
Sehmat is alert. She moves past Saadiq's shop, to a dupatta 
vendor, as if that's where she was headed all along. As 
Munira reaches her, Sehmat asks casually -

are too risky and can be seen. Frustrated she sits on the 
covered pot and draws a breath, when she spots a ledge 
running around the top half of the bathroom. She gets on top 
of the commode to look.
Just then, outside, Iqbal opens the bedroom door and enters. 
Sehmat hears footsteps approach the bathroom and realises she 
hasn't locked the door. She can't get to the door in time. 
She steps down and pulls her kurta off, as if she's not 
dressed from the shower yet. Iqbal opens the door, sees her

chivalrous.

locking it. Sehmat looks at him. She fights her tears. Mir 
speaks, softly.

down her face. He hugs her, fiercely.

Iqbal picks up one payal.
IQBAL

Sehmat nods. She holds her foot up. Iqbal looks at her.
IQBAL (CONT’D)
Tumhein chhoona padega...
Sehmat reacts at his sensitivity. A tear falls down her face 
as she looks at Iqbal's honest, trusting eyes. She nods, 
wordlessly.  Iqbal fastens the payal around her ankles. First 
one, then the other.
He gets to his feet.
IQBAL (CONT’D)

He turns to leave, when Sehmat impulsively holds his hand.

turns and sees Iqbal standing by. He moves to her, opens the 
ribbon and pulls out a record.
Sehmat reacts as she listens to the music being played. As 
Iqbal settles down on the sofa, he notices that his cigarette 
case has been replaced with a crystal bowl filled with mishri 
and elaichi. He gives Sehmat a knowing smile. She smiles 
back, smug.

Sehmat moves into the study and hurries to the desk. She 
moves some papers and sees a file that is bound and tied and 
looks important. It's red and blue, has a government insignia 
and says 'Classified'. The same she had seen Syed carrying.
With trembling hands, Sehmat opens the file. She sees the top 
papers, they are mechanical drawings and nautical charts. 
Suddenly, the doorknob turns. Nazima opens the door but just 
then she is called for.
ZAYN

Nazima turns away and doesn’t see Sehmat who is hurriedly

He leans on the table and speaks, impassioned.

Syed, Mehboob and Iqbal are also among the audience. Munira 
is in the wings with Sehmat.
As the song ends, the audience gives them a standing ovation.  
Little Zayn runs to the wings and taking Sehmat's hand, 
brings her out on stage. Embarrassed and red-faced, she takes 
a bow with the students. Syed looks on, proud. Iqbal claps

Sehmat enters the bathroom, shuts the door and dismantles the 
Morse unit. She hides it in the flush tank of the commode.
She takes off her clothes, shoves them at the bottom of the 
laundry hamper and steps into the shower. Leaning against the 
tiles, her shoulders finally slump and she breaks into sobs. 
The enormity of what she's done sinks into her.

Dressed in her nightgown, Sehmat moves to the bed and lays

Jonga over Abdul plays in her head.
She lets out a gasp, shaking uncontrollably now.

Syed is reading the newspaper, Iqbal sitting by him at the 
dining table. They look up as Mehboob walks in, still in his 
uniform of the previous day. He looks tired and spent. He 
sits at the table.
Iqbal and Syed search Mehboob with the obvious question. 
Mehboob shakes his head in a No. Iqbal draws a ragged breath.

Mehboob's photograph. Syed can't speak anymore, tears fall 
down his face with grief he's unable to contain. Iqbal moves 
to his father, wraps a strong hand around his shoulders and 
leads him back to a chair. Iqbal then moves to address the 
mourners.
