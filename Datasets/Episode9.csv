"ON BLACK:
A joyous Bundelkhandi FOLK SONG being sung in chorus.
FADE IN:
EXT. CHITRAKOOT - TYAGI’S HOUSE - COURTYARD - DAY 9.1 9.1
A group of EUNUCHS singing and dancing.
Plates of sweets and glasses of tea being distributed to 
RELATIVES and NEIGHBOURS assembled there.
A much younger version of TYAGI’S MOTHER (who we saw in 
Episode 3) sits holding a cute little baby.
TWO LITTLE GIRLS - Tyagi’s sisters - fawn over him.The courtyard - full of happy, smiling faces. Except for -IN A CORNER
:
A PANDIT. He sits with a younger version of TYAGI’S FATHER 
(we saw him too in Episode 3).
The Pandit finishes up making a horoscope in his notebook. On *
which, a name is seen - ‘Vishal Tyagi’.  And then as he *
studies it - creases begin to appear on his forehead.Tyagi’s father looks at him.
TYAGI’S FATHER
Kaa bhayo Shastri ji?
The Pandit frowns - still unable to take his eyes off the 
horoscope.
TYAGI’S FATHER (CONT’D)
Kachhu toh kaho maharaj. Badi 
mannatan ke baad milo hai mooro. 
Jaa pe hee aas hai, ki jameen 
chhudwayego purkhan ki.
(beat; nervous)
Chhudwayego na?
The Pandit finally looks at him.
PANDIT
Jameen toh chhudwa dego... apne har 
dusman ko narsanhar karego je 
mooro..."
"Tyagi’s father’s face lights up. He SHOUTS OUT to one of his 
daughters - 
TYAGI’S FATHER
Ae Jhunki, mithaayi laa pandit ji 
ke layi...
While he himself comes out with fifty one rupees and offers them to the Pandit.
The Pandit takes the money tentatively. He looks a little 
troubled.
Tyagi’s father senses it.
TYAGI’S FATHER (CONT’D)
Kachhu aur baat rahi, maharaj?
PANDIT
Sinh raashi mein surya balwaan hai. 
Aur Shani bhi aathvein grah mein 
baitho hai. Upar se - 
TYAGI’S FATHER
(cuts him)
Hum bhaye anpadh kisaan maharaj! Je 
Rahu Ketu kaa samjhenge! Seedhey 
seedhey bataao... patri theek toh 
hai na?
PANDIT
Patri toh laakhon mein ek hai. 
Par...
TYAGI’S FATHER
Par kain Pandit ji?
The Pandit looks at him gravely.
PANDIT
Par insaan ki nahi, asuran ki patri 
hai je. Daitya Hiranyakashyap ki 
patri.
Tyagi’s father - taken aback.
PANDIT (CONT’D)
Asuran ko raja raho Hiranyakashyap. 
Vaa ne vardaan hato Brahma ji ko – ‘Ki putra na tu din mein marego, naa raat mein... na mitra dwara, na shatru dwara... Na aksmaat marego na koi saajis se... 
(beat)
(MORE)2."
"Bhagwan Vishnu ke fir Narsinh 
avatar leno pado vaa ke vadh ke layi.
(folds hands with respect; 
mutters)
Vishnu! Vishnu!
Tyagi’s father – confused. It’s all too much for him.
PANDIT (CONT’D)
Tor moora ke paas bhi wahi vardaan haigo Brahma ji ko. Na din na raat, na mitra na shatru... koi na maar sakego jaa ne. Sivaay ek aadmi ke...
Tyagi’s father looks at him.
The Pandit says something grave. But we don’t hear it as the 
song of the eunuchs take a rousing turn.
Tyagi’s father sits stunned as behind - The eunuchs dance in joy - Round and round they go.ANGLE ON - The cute little infant, smiling with innocence. We 
go CLOSER and CLOSER to him.
TITLE APPEARS - ‘SWARG KA DWAAR’ROLL OPENING CREDITS
EXT. JAMUNA PAAR POLICE STATION - NIGHT 9.2 9.2
Ansari emerges out of the police station, dialling Hathi 
Ram’s number.
ANSARI
(to himself)
Come on sir... phone uthaao...
The phone rings out.
Ansari - a little worried. He tries the number again.
EXT. CHITRAKOOT HIGHWAY - MOVING VEHICLE + VILLAGE FAIR - 9.3 9.3
NIGHT
A deserted highway. An SUV hurtles on it, with a bhajan 
blaring from it.INSIDE THE SUV -PANDIT (CONT’D)
3."
"Hathi Ram sits upfront with Om ji - Who drives the SUV.
Sitting in the back seat - Firangi. In his one hand - a gun. 
In the other hand - Hathi Ram’s ringing phone which is *
irritating Firangi. *
FIRANGI
Imran Ansari caalling. Kaun hai je bhosadi waalo? Baar baar phone kar raho hai...
A tense Hathi Ram speaks up.
HATHI RAM
Usey pata hai main kahaan hoon. Dekho, police waala hoon. Mujhe kuchh hua - 
OM JI
(ignoring him)
Re Firangi! Tain ne pato hai? Police waalan ke ek ek goli ko hisaab deno padey hai. Galti se goli chalaayi toh vaa ki poori rapat likhaani padey hai, rapat...
An annoyed Firangi puts the gun on Hathi Ram’s head. *
FIRANGI
Hamanne koi hisaab naa deno padto, kaptaan! Toh shaant baith. 
(irritated)
Aur bhajan sun, bhajan...
OM JI
Arey toh kaa dikkat hai bhajan sunney mein? Dekh kitti badhiya *
baat kar rahe hain sant mahaaraj. *
Shakal hans mein ram biraje. Matbal *
hans, kauvva, gaay, bakri, kutta, *
bhagwan kahu ki sakal mein bhi aa *
sakat hain... samjho? *
FIRANGI *
Police waalan ki sakal mein bhi? *
As Om ji and Firangi burst out laughing, Hathi Ram notices a *
little away - LIGHTS. It looks like a VILLAGE FAIR.
Hathi Ram’s mind - racing. Just then - high beam headlights *
from an oncoming truck hit the car.Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 4."
"Om ji and Firangi squint and cover their eyes. Hathi Ram 
senses an opportunity. He quickly but discreetly ties his seat belt and then -
GRABS the steering and SWINGS it hard to a side.The SUV hurtles off the highway as Om ji loses control. Firangi SCREAMS. The truck BLARES its loud horn.THUD THUD THUD. A series of bumps later - the SUV CRASHES 
into a small pit, sending the three hurtling against the dashboard and ceiling.
Darkness. Dust. And once it settles down - we see them trying 
to regain their senses.
Hathi Ram - injured, though less than the other two because 
of the seat belt. Blood oozes out of a deep cut in his forehead. But he somehow manages to take off his seat belt, open the door and fall out of the car.
While Firangi tries to revive his brother.
FIRANGI (CONT’D)
Dadda? Tain theek ho, Dadda?
He flips out his phone and dials a number.OUTSIDE - Hathi Ram gets up and stumbles away.Firangi realises and tries to go after him. Then remembers to 
look for his gun in the crashed car.
FIRANGI (CONT’D)
Morichod bandook kitey hai?
Hathi Ram continues to limp towards the gates of the fair.
EXT. CHITRAKOOT - VILLAGE FAIR + WOOLEN’S STALL - NIGHT 9.4 9.4
People going in and out of various stalls and eateries. 
Music. Noise. The place looks lively.
Hathi Ram tries to mingle in with the crowd.His eyes go to - A WOOLENS STALL
: Shawls, sweaters and mufflers being sold.
Hathi Ram rushes towards it.5."
"The Shawl Seller looks at his fucked up state with suspicion 
as -
Hathi Ram picks up a shawl. Wraps it around himself, even 
covering his face.
SHAWL SELLER
Saadhe chaar sau.
Hathi Ram hastily checks his pocket - Only 200 odd rupees.
HATHI RAM
Do sau.
SHAWL SELLER
Chaar sau ka toh hamein girta hai... Laao, waapas karo...
The Shawl Seller tries to grab the shawl back from Hathi Ram.
A tense Hathi Ram glances back. Firangi is coming in his 
direction, looking all around.
Shit. Hathi Ram can’t let go of the shawl at this point. He 
holds on. A tussle ensues. It’s tense, but kind of funny.
Firangi - now just a little away. He’s on the phone, giving 
instructions to someone - 
FIRANGI
(into the phone;)
Oo jo melo lago hai bypass taraf, 
haan wahi... seedhey bheetar aao...
Hathi Ram gives his fiercest glare to the Shawl Seller, and whispers angrily -
HATHI RAM
Police waala hoon bhonsadi ke. Chup 
chaap de de warna ye thela bandh 
karwa doonga tera...
The colour goes off Shawl Seller’s face as he lets go of the shawl.
Firangi runs away in a direction.Hathi Ram throws the two hundred rupees at the Shawl Seller, 
before running away in the opposite direction to Firangi, his face covered with the shawl.
He has only gone a little distance when he sees – a bleeding 
Om ji coming in his direction.6."
"Damn. Hathi Ram turns and enters -
INT. CHITRAKOOT - VILLAGE FAIR - MAKESHIFT THEATRE - NIGHT 9.5 9.5
A crowded tent. Hathi Ram tries to mix in with the crowd.
ON THE STAGE :
A play in progress. The ‘Bhakt Prahlad’ story being enacted 
by AMATEUR ACTORS.
HIRANYAKASHYAP
Je aiso hai Prahlad, aur je tain 
itto hee bado bhagat hai, toh bula 
torey Vishnu ke...
PRAHLAD
(cries out)
Vishnu! Morey Vishnu!
Hathi Ram notices – Om ji entering the tent, looking in the crowd.
And then - Their eyes meet. Shit.Om ji rushes towards Hathi Ram through the crowd. Hathi Ram 
looks around - no other exit. He’s trapped.
ON STAGE - Prahlad lets out one last wail - 
PRAHLAD (CONT’D)
HAAY VISHNU!
And then - The backdrop of the stage gets torn apart from 
outside. And the half-man, half-lion NARSINGH AVATAR emerges from it.
Loud cheer and clapping from the crowd. People stand up to 
have ‘darshan’ and take his blessings, and that blocks Om ji.
Hathi Ram senses an opportunity. He dashes towards the stage, 
crosses it and jumps out of the torn backdrop - 
Even as Narsingh Avatar, Hiranyakashyap and Prahlad look at 
each other, confused.
EXT. CHITRAKOOT - VILLAGE FAIR - STAIRS + WELL OF DEATH - 9.6 9.6
NIGHT
Hathi Ram runs past the crowd.Om ji too manages to emerge out of the tent and chases him.7."
"And then Hathi Ram realises - Firangi is coming straight at 
him from the front.
Shit. Hathi Ram notices some steps. A crowd on top of the 
stairs. Hathi Ram rushes up the stairs.
Om ji and Firangi follow him from two directions.Hathi Ram reaches the top platform where the crowd is and 
realises it’s a ‘MAUT KA KUAN’. No way to go further.
EXT. CHITRAKOOT - VILLAGE FAIR - WELL OF DEATH - NIGHT 9.7 9.7
A BIKER performs serious daredevilry inside, swirling round 
and round the steep cylindrical space. 
Om ji and Firangi draw their guns as they rush towards Hathi 
Ram from two different directions.
Damn. Hathi Ram takes a deep breath and makes a decision. And 
then he climbs the railing. And jumps off - 
Right into the well. He slides down the slope dangerously, 
just about managing to avoid the swirling bike, and hits the ground hard.
Some men in the crowd cheer, assuming it to be a part of the 
act.
INSIDE THE WELL - Hathi Ram lies on the floor. The startled 
biker - trying to slow down.
A COUPLE OF ORGANISERS in the well rush towards him.Hathi Ram somehow manages to get up. He pushes the angry men 
aside and heads straight towards - 
A wooden door.He opens it in a flash and jumps out. Only to come across - FOUR GOONS.One of them swings the rod in his hand and it gets Hathi Ram 
on the head.
FADE TO BLACK: *
ON BLACK -
Silence.Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 8."
"And then – THUPP. THUPP. A sound at rhythmic intervals. 
Accompanied by the barking of dogs.
FADE IN:
EXT. CHITRAKOOT JUNGLE - FARMHOUSE - NIGHT 9.8 9.8
It’s Om ji and Firangi digging a hole in the ground – large *
enough to be someone’s grave.
Two dogs sit nearby. *
We’ve been here before in Episode 8. It’s Tyagi’s Jungle 
hideout. The Shivaling and the dogs confirm that to us. *
A LITTLE AWAY ON A COT :
Gwala Gujjar chews a juicy piece of mutton off his plate, while Om ji and Firangi squat on the ground, smoking beedis.
The Old Sadhu comes up with a fresh roti for him.
Firangi gives a naughty glance to Om ji.
FIRANGI
(to the Sadhu)
Kaa maharaj! Chaar aadmi chaar 
ghante mein ek gaddha khodat hain. Toh ek aadmi aath ghante mein kitte gaddhe khodego?
OLD SADHU
(irritated)
Aath khode, assi khode, apni maiyya ki bur khodein bhonsadi waale hum se kaa...
Om ji and Firangi crack up. Until - Gwala gives them a look.
They shut up. But only till – Gwala himself cracks up.The Old Sadhu walks away, mumbling in annoyance.Om ji and Firangi continue to laugh as Gwala washes his hands 
with a jug of water.
Until – something stirs nearby.Gwala turns to look. It’s Hathi Ram - lying on the ground, 
trying to get up.
Dried up blood over his face. One eye barely open. Swollen 
lips. He looks seriously fucked up.Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 9."
"Hathi Ram somehow manages to get up on his knees.
He looks around. At Gwala. At the grave being dug. His head 
spins.
He just about manages to mutter -
HATHI RAM
Paani.
Gwala walks up to him with the jug. Hathi Ram grabs it with 
shaking hands and gulps down some water thirstily, pouring the rest over his head.
GWALA GUJJAR
Kuchh khaaoge? Mutton badhiya bana hai...
Hathi Ram looks at him.
GWALA GUJJAR (CONT’D)
Inspector Hathi Ram Chaudhary. Thana Outer Jamuna Paar. Duty se suspended par tafteesh jaari.
Gwala squats down next to Hathi Ram.
GWALA GUJJAR (CONT’D)
Toh? Kya pata lagaaya?
Hathi Ram – barely able to keep himself straight.
But he leans in closer to Gwala. Whispers in his ear.
HATHI RAM
(whispers)
Yehi ki Donullia mar chuka hai.
Gwala looks at him sharply. Then grabs his throat hard. And 
presses.
Hathi Ram chokes as Gwala’s thick, hard hands continue to 
press.
But he manages to blurt out –
HATHI RAM (CONT’D)
Aur ye bhi ki ye baat jaanne waala 
main akela nahi...
Gwala’s grip slowly loosens. Finally – he lets go of Hathi 
Ram’s throat.
Hathi Ram gasps for breath in desperation.10."
"Gwala stares at him. *
GWALA GUJJAR
Aur kaun jaanta hai?
HATHI RAM
Wahi jisne Tyagi ko fansaaya.
Gwala looks at him with surprise.
HATHI RAM (CONT’D)
Iss kaam pe Tyagi ko bhejne ke liye 
aap se kisne kahaa tha?
Beat. A stunned Gwala murmurs -
GWALA GUJJAR
Bajpayee jee? Par...?
HATHI RAM
Donullia beemaar thha kya? Bajpayee ko khabar lag gayi hogi...
Gwala just stares at the ground in silence. And we INSERT - 
EXT. CHITRAKOOT JUNGLE - HIDEOUT - DAY 9.9 9.9
A scene we have seen earlier. 
A tent. A pair of canvas shoes. The scared doctor checks a pulse.Then turns to Gwala Gujjar and shakes his head.Gwala just stands there - stunned.Everything around - Still. Silent.And then, in a flash, Kana Commando points his gun at the 
Doctor’s temple. And fires.
The Doctor goes down like a felled tree.Gwala and Kana Commando stand there, fighting back the tears.
EXT. CHITRAKOOT JUNGLE - FARMHOUSE - NIGHT 9.10 9.10
Back with Hathi Ram and Gwala Gujjar.Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 11."
"HATHI RAM
Donullia ki maut ki khabar baahar 
aaye, uske pehle aap raajneeti mein aana chahte thhe. Par shaayad Bajpayee ko ye manzoor nahi thha. Uss ke liye aap log bahubali thhe, businessman thhe, par politician nahi.
Gwala looks at him.
HATHI RAM (CONT’D)
Mana karne par aap ke naaraz honey ka khatra thha, par Donullia ke jaane ke baad Bajpayee shaayad is risk ke liye taiyyaar thha. Par ab bhi usey aap ke ek aadmi se khatra thha. Tyagi.
And then we see the following VISUALS (seen earlier in Episode 1) over Hathi Ram’s voice.
MONTAGE - VARIOUSINT. HOTEL UPTOWN - ROOM #1 - DAY 9.11A 9.11A
Tyagi meets Chaaku, Kabir and Cheeni.
HATHI RAM (V.O.)
Usne aap se kahaa Tyagi ko Dilli 
bhejne ke liye – ek assignment pe. Chaar logon ki ek team khadi ki, taaki assignment bilkul asli lagey. Aap maan gaye, kyunki aap ko laga iss assignment ke baad shaayad Bajpayee aap ko Chitrakoot ka ticket de de.

"HATHI RAM (V.O.)
Wahaan Bajpayee ke liye kaam karne 
waali Delhi Police ki ek team un chaaron ka intezaar kar rahi thhi. Teen din tak follow karti rahi. Plan thha ki jaise hee Tyagi uss journalist pe goli chalaaye, usey aur uski team ko wahin encounter mein shoot kar diya jaaye. Bajpayee ke liye Tyagi ka safaaya aur afsaron ke liye medal – matlab dono ka faayda. Upar se ek journalist ke murder se Dilli mein jo hungama hota, wo bonus. 
EXT. HOTEL UPTOWN - DAY 9.11C 9.11C
Tyagi and his team leave with the bags. The hotel waiter comes with the bill. Chaaku has an argument with the waiter. 
They drive away.
HATHI RAM (V.O.)
Lekin – Tyagi ne goli nahi 
chalaayi. Masterji se baat karne ki zid karta raha. Aur jab uski baat nahi hui, toh usne assignment cancel kar diya.
EXT. HOTEL UPTOWN - DAY 9.11D 9.11D
Delhi Police cars come to a screeching halt outside the hotel. They rush in, only to come out a little later and drive away.
HATHI RAM (V.O.)

Bhagat aur uski team ne Tyagi ka 
peechha kiya aur usey Jamuna Bridge pe ghera. Par naseeb ki baat ki usi waqt media ki ek OB van usi bridge pe thhi. ACP Bhagat goli nahi chalaa paaya aur usey Tyagi ko arrest karna pada.
EXT. CHITRAKOOT JUNGLE - FARMHOUSE - NIGHT 9.12 9.12
We’re back with Hathi Ram and Gwala. From a little away, Om ji and Firangi watch them.
HATHI RAM
Bas tab se sach pata lagaane ke chakkar mein iss case mein apna chutiya kataa raha hoon...
Gwala fixes Hathi Ram with a cold, menacing gaze. Then draws out a gun, cocks it and puts it on Hathi Ram’s head.
GWALA GUJJAR
Pata toh laga liya. Ab karne kya waale ho iss sach ka?
Despite his fucked up state, Hathi Ram lets out a sarcastic little laugh.
HATHI RAM
Aap ne ye duniya mujhse zyaada dekhi hai, Gwala Bhai. Aap ko kya lagta hai? Chaahun bhi toh kya kar sakta hoon?
Gwala stares into Hathi Ram’s eyes for a long time.
Then turns around and fires.BANG! The bullet gets Firangi. And he drops like a fallen 
tree, right into the grave.
Hathi Ram - stunned.He watches in silence as Gwala walks up to a shocked Om ji.Gwala looks at Firangi’s body lying in the grave. And then at 
Om ji.
GWALA GUJJAR
Siraf teen logan ke khabar hati Masterji ki. Main, tain, aur toro *
bhai. Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 14."
"Om ji looks at him.
GWALA GUJJAR (CONT’D)
Aur itto jaanun hoon, ki tain toh 
kabahu na kar sakey je dhokho morey sangey.
Tears well up in Om ji’s eyes. His knees buckle. And he slumps to the ground, and breaks down like a child.
A stoic Gwala puts a comforting hand over his head, as Om ji 
clings to Gwala’s legs.
EXT. CHITRAKOOT JUNGLE - OUTSIDE THE FARMHOUSE - NIGHT 9.13 9.13
An SUV. Om ji waits outside it.
A little away - Hathi Ram and Gwala.
GWALA GUJJAR *
Tumhaari gun aur phone Om ji de *
denge. *
Gwala takes out something from his pocket. *
He touches it to his eyes reverentially, then offers it to 
Hathi Ram.
GWALA GUJJAR (CONT’D)
Ye Masterji ka rudraksh hai. Tyagi ko de dena.
(beat)
Usey haq hai jaanne ka ki main Masterji se uski baat kyun nahi karwa paaya...
Hathi Ram takes it.
The dogs come towards Gwala, wagging their tails.Om ji gets into the car. Starts the engine.But Hathi Ram lingers - his eyes on Gwala.
HATHI RAM
Ek sawaal mera bhi tha aapse. Tyagi 
ne Sanjeev Mehra ko maara kyun nahi?
Gwala looks at him.Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 15."
"HATHI RAM (CONT’D)
Kya baat karna chahta thha wo 
Masterji se?
Gwala pats the dogs - his cold eyes on Hathi Ram.

Hathi Ram continues to sit there. We notice something between *
his fingers - a rudraksh. *
We STAY ON Hathi Ram’s face as the bus begins to move. *
FADE OUT / IN:
INT. NEWS NOW OFFICE - RECEPTION - DAY 9.15 9.15
A television plays at the reception. The ticker - ‘Trial 
begins tomorrow in Sanjeev Mehra assassination attempt case’.
Sara walks in. The Receptionist cups the phone she was 
talking into - 
RECEPTIONIST
Hurry up, you’re late. 
(beat)
And save some champagne for me. 
Sara looks at her weirdly, as the Receptionist goes back to her phone call.
INT. NEWS NOW OFFICE - FLOOR - DAY 9.16 9.16
POP! A champagne bottle pops open.
It’s an impromptu office party happening. Music plays on a 
desktop somewhere.
Champagne getting poured in Styrofoam cups.Everyone mingling around, laughing.Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 16."
"Sara walks in to see - A few employees hoisting a laughing 
Sanjeev up a desk, while everyone around chants - 
NEWS CHANNEL EMPLOYEES
Speech! Speech! Speech!
SANJEEV
Alright, alright! You asked for it.
Polite laughter.
SANJEEV (CONT’D)
I know the last couple of years have been tough for all of us. And the future has looked uncertain for a while. But this is to tell you that things are now looking bright, and we have a new management stepping in, which believes in us and is ready to back us. They’ve promised us a free hand in what we do.
Mild cheer from employees.
SANJEEV (CONT’D)
And a pay raise.
This time, everyone
 cheers.
SANJEEV (CONT’D)
That one always works. Enjoy the day. And go easy on the champagne. We still have a day’s work to do.
A few groans.
And then the music picks up.Someone hands Sara a glass of champagne. She stands holding 
it - unsure, out of place with all the excitement around her.
As a chuffed Sanjeev gets down from the desk -Jai walks up to him.
JAI
Good on you, bro. Good on us.
He gives Sanjeev a hug - who looks just a bit awkward.17."
"SANJEEV
I guess there’s no easy way to say 
this, so I’ll just go for it straight.
(beat)
Kapoor doesn’t want you around.
It knocks the wind out of Jai.
SANJEEV (CONT’D)
Sorry, man. I tried talking to him. But he wants to bring in his nephew.
(beat)
I’ve made sure there’s a good severance package for you in there.
Jai stares at him – with anger and heartbreak. 
SANJEEV (CONT’D)
Excuse me, I got a meeting...
Sanjeev walks away from there, a little twinkle of satisfaction in his eyes.
A LITTLE LATER
:
Someone cracks a joke. A bunch of employees crack up. A 
little away from them - 
A bored Sara stands alone, sipping champagne.Her eyes go to - THE CONFERENCE ROOM
:
It’s Sanjeev, hobnobbing with Vikram Kapoor and a PR LADY.The laughter, the bonhomie, the backslapping.Disappointment rises on Sara’s face as she stares at Sanjeev.She walks up to the dustbin, and empties her glass down. And 
then walks up to her desk.
And starts typing something on her computer.
INT. NEWS NOW OFFICE - SANJEEV’S CABIN - DAY 9.17 9.17*
All eyes on Sanjeev. He frowns.Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 18."
"SANJEEV
Isn’t it too early for an 
autobiography? I mean, doesn’t it sound a bit... pretentious?
VIKRAM KAPOOR
Toh autobiography mat bolo, kuchh aur bol lo... What’s that French word, Nikki?
PR WOMAN
Memoir.
VIKRAM KAPOOR
(chewing it)
Mem-wah. See, nothing sounds pretentious if you say it like the French.
SANJEEV
But Vikram...
Kapoor Saab gets up, announcing an end to the meeting.
VIKRAM KAPOOR
Brand banta hai, yaar. Tumhaara bhi, channel ka bhi. And all you know, there might be a movie deal on its way somewhere.
The PR LADY chimes in.
PR LADY
Oh, yes. Bollywood loves biopics. That’s all they seem to be making these days.
VIKRAM KAPOOR
Of course! You need inspirational stories to survive this chutiya country.
(beat; winks)
Pardon my French, Nikki.
A round of laughter and shaking of hands later, Kapoor and the PR Lady walk out.
As Sanjeev picks up his papers - Sara enters the conference 
room.
She puts down a paper in front of Sanjeev.Sanjeev looks at it. It’s a resignation letter.19."
"Sanjeev sighs; signals her to sit down. She does, albeit 
reluctantly.
SANJEEV
Have you thought this through?
Sara lets out a smile.
SARA
Not really.
SANJEEV
You think you’re making a statement by doing this. But trust me, it makes no difference to anybody. No one will know. No one will care.
SARA
It makes a difference to me.
Sanjeev stares at her for a while. And then signs on the resignation letter - ‘Approved’.
And just then - someone BARGES in.His face fucked up, his clothes disheveled. It’s Hathi Ram. 
Behind - The RECEPTIONIST and a SECURITY GUARD are trying to stop him.
The Guard manages to grab Hathi Ram’s shoulder.Hathi Ram turns around. Looks at his shoulder. And then at 
the security guy.
Dead cold.
HATHI RAM
Dilli Police hoon bhenchod.
Beat. The Guard takes his hand off and backs away in fear.
SANJEEV
What nonsense is this?
HATHI RAM
Baat karni hai aapse. Aapke case ko 
le ke...
SANJEEV
Toh appointment le ke aao.
Hathi Ram gives him a glare.20."
"HATHI RAM
Dekho sir, aisa hai. Abhi miloge 
toh aap hee ke liye achcha hoga.
Beat. An awkward silence in the room.
Sanjeev finally signals the guards to leave.
SANJEEV
Bolo kya bolna thha.
HATHI RAM
Ek kahaani sunaani thhi.
He gives Sanjeev a smile. Sits down.
HATHI RAM (CONT’D)
Pandav jab apna raaj paat khatam 
karne ke baad dharti chhod kar swarg jaa rahe thhe, toh ek kutta unke saath saath ho liya. 
Sanjeev looks at him - ‘what the fuck are you talking about?’ Hathi Ram signals to him for some patience.
HATHI RAM (CONT’D)
Raasta kathin thha. Chalte chalte raaste mein ek ek kar ke saare pandav khatam ho gaye. Jab tak Yudhishthir swarg ke dwaar tak pahunche, unke saath sirf wo kutta bacha.
Sanjeev gets up with impatience -
SANJEEV
I really don’t have time for this.
HATHI RAM
Aap ki kahaaniyan do maheene se roz TV pe sun rahe hain, Mehra saab. Ek din hamaari bhi sun lijiye. Please.
Sanjeev stares at him. Then sits down, reluctantly. And listens to the rest of it with a scowl.
HATHI RAM (CONT’D)
Toh swarg ke dwaar par Indra ne Yudhishthir ko andar invite kiya. Yudhishthir ne kutte ko saath laane ki maang ki. Indra ne kahaa - ‘Ek tuchh kutta swarg mein? Asambhav’.

"Yudhishthir boley – ‘Poore raaste 
mere bhai bhi mera saath nahi de sakey, sirf is kutte ne mera saath diya hai. Agar ye nahi jaayega, toh main bhi nahi jaaunga.’ Ye keh kar Yudhisthir waapas lautne lage.Tabhi Indra ne unka haath thaama aur kahaa ki ‘Maharaj, aap pariksha mein safal hue. Ye kutta swayam Bhagwan Dharma hain. Swarg mein aap ka swagat hai’.
Hathi Ram smiles.
HATHI RAM (CONT’D)
Waise toh ye sab shaastron mein bhi likha hai, par maine Whatsapp pe padha.
Sanjeev - on the edge of his patience here. Even Sara seems to be wondering where this is going.
SANJEEV
Iss bakwaas ka mere case se kya matlab hai bataoge?
Hathi Ram fixes him with a gaze.
HATHI RAM
Aap ki life mein bhi ek kutta bhagwan ban ke aaya. Fark sirf yehi hai ki is kutte ne aap ko swarg pahunchaaya nahi, balki pahunchne se bacha liya.

A POV VIDEO
, shot from a mobile, that we’ve seen before in 
Episode 4.
IN THE POV VIDEO : Sanjeev, dressed for work, walks out of his 
house, smoking a cigarette, while the car reverses out of the 
house.
VOICES can be heard in the video.
CHAAKU’S VOICE (O.S.)
Yehi hai?
TYAGI’S VOICE (O.S.)
Haan.HATHI RAM (CONT’D)22."
"CHAAKU’S VOICE (O.S.)
Abhi karna hai? Koi nahi hai...
But just then - Dolly walks out of the house, with a dog 
bowl.
She calls out the stray dog ‘Savitri’. And it quickly makes 
its way to Dolly, wagging its tail.
The dog goes to Sanjeev - who’s about to get into the car. 
Sanjeev looks a bit uncomfortable.
Dolly takes Sanjeev’s hand and makes him pat the dog. The dog  
licks Sanjeev’s hand all over.
Dolly laughs, as finally Sanjeev gets into the car. And 
drives away.
HATHI RAM (V.O.)
Aapke us assassin Tyagi ko kutton se bahot pyaar tha. Apne guru ki ek baat usne gaanth baandh rakhi thhi – ki kutton se pyaar karne waale achche log hotey hain.
The Video stays on Dolly for a little while, as she plays with the dog. And as it ENDS, we SWITCH TO -
Tyagi looking at Dolly. She now sits on the pavement, with 
the dog in her lap. And Dolly, the broken Dolly, looks happy in this moment.
Tyagi continues to look at her for a while. And a little 
smile comes up on his face.
HATHI RAM (V.O.)
Aap ki beewi ko us kuttey ka dhyaan rakhte dekh kar pehli baar usey Guru ke diye hue aadesh pe doubt hua. Guru se baat karna chahta thha ek baar, unke munh se khud sunna chahta thha ki ye kaam karey ya nahi.

"He looks at Sanjeev - square.
HATHI RAM (CONT’D)
Tyagi jitna bhi khoonkhar criminal 
raha ho, thodi bahot insaaniyat uske andar bhi thhi.
Sanjeev – shocked. Even Sara’s trying to process it.
HATHI RAM (CONT’D)

Is case ka aap se koi lena dena nahi.
Sanjeev looks at him in confusion.
SANJEEV
Matlab?
HATHI RAM
Matlab aap ki jagah target koi bhi ho sakta thha. Kisi ko koi farak nahi padta. In fact, target aap thhe hee nahi. Target Tyagi thha. Aap toh bas ek bahaana thhe, Tyagi ko baahar nikaal ke usey encounter karne ka.
Sanjeev – now truly stunned. He murmurs in protest -
SANJEEV
Ye... ye tum... I mean... CBI ne poori investigation ki hai. ISI involved thha... sab jaante hain...
Hathi Ram just sits there smiling at him.
HATHI RAM
Ajeeb baat hai, Mehra Saab. Aap ko toh yeh sun ke khush hona chahiye, ki aap ki jaan pe koi khatra nahi. Par aap toh...
Sanjeev – confused. Shaken.

A smirk comes up on Sara’s face while Sanjeev snaps in a mix 
of anger and hurt.
SANJEEV
Tum... tum bakwaas kar rahe ho. Kuchh nahi jaante tum. Naukri se bhi suspended ho apne fuck ups ki wajah se...
Hathi Ram gets up.
HATHI RAM
Aap se pehli baar mila thha toh laga ki aap kitne badey aadmi hain. Aur main kitna chhota. Is case mein maine jitni bhi marwaayi ho, kam se kam meri ye galatfehmi toh door ho gayi.
Hathi Ram walks out, leaving behind a shaken Sanjeev.
Sanjeev looks at Sara.
SANJEEV
This... this can’t leave the room.
A naughty smile comes up on Sara’s face.
SANJEEV (CONT’D)
It’s not right. You don’t know if 
this is really the truth.
Sara gets up - ready to go.
SARA
You’re right, I don’t. But I want you to live with the knowledge that if I want, I can do to you what you did to those four guys.
SANJEEV
(more like to himself)
No one’s going to believe you. An affair gone wrong... that’s what they’re going to say.
Sara just quietly walks away from there, a smile dancing on her lips.

Sitting nearby on a bench – Tyagi, Chaaku and Cheeni. Tied 
around their wrists are ropes, which are held by three different POLICE MEN. *

cleaning the corridors with a broom.
ANGLE ON the bench. The three undertrials.The Sweeper approaches the bench, sweeping the floor. One of 
the policemen gives him a look, yawns and then looks away.

walks away, struggling to hold back his tears.
As he’s trying to get away from there, he bumps into someone.It’s Hathi Ram.Their eyes meet for a moment. And then Kaaliya disappears 
from there.
Hathi Ram looks at – the three undertrials on the bench. As he starts to approach them, a CONSTABLE ON COURT DUTY 
walks out of the courtroom and announces -

The CBI lawyer signals to Sunil Gautam and the cops – ‘ let’s 
go’.
The cops tug at the ropes of the undertrials . Tyagi, Chaaku 
and Cheeni stand up.Hathi Ram quickly makes his way past the people in the 
corridor. He comes right next to Tyagi, and slips something in his fingers, whispering - 
HATHI RAM
Gwala Bhai ne di hai. Kaha tum samajh jaaoge.
A surprised Tyagi turns to look at Hathi Ram. And then at his hand. It’s the ‘rudraksh’.35."
"Tyagi stops in his steps.
The cop realises. He tugs at Tyagi’s rope - But Tyagi isn’t moving. He just stands there staring at the 
rudraksh. Stunned.
The cop comes to pull Tyagi away by his arm.Hathi Ram watches Tyagi being taken away. Then turns around 
and walks away.
And everything goes SLO.ANGLE ON Tyagi. He turns to look at the cop who’s pulling him 
along.
And then around. Faces all around him. Cops. Criminals. 
Lawyers.
Tyagi looks lost. We STAY ON him as slowly, tears start to 
flow from his anguished eyes. At this point, he looks like a boy who lost his father. Not the dreaded killer we have come to know.
And then something comes upon him. His face hardens into a 
resolve.
And in a FLASH, Tyagi lunges and grabs the gun tucked to the 
side band of a SUB INSPECTOR.
The cop pulling Tyagi realises. But before he can react, 
Tyagi pushes him away hard. The cop falls to the side and the rope drops from his hand.
PANDIT (V.O.)
Tor moora ke paas bhi wahi vardaan haigo Brahma ji ko. Na din na raat, na mitra na shatru... koi na maar sakego jaa ne. Sivaay ek aadmi ke...

But Tyagi is already running down the corridor, with the gun *
in his hand. *
People in the corridor shriek. Run about. Sunil Gautam 
shouts. Chaos.
Hathi Ram hears the commotion. Turns to look. And is shocked 
to see -
