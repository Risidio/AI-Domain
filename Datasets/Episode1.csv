"ON BLACK:
TITLE appears - BRIDGES
And then - A matter-of-fact, tired voice.
HATHI RAM (V.O.)
Ye jo duniya hai na duniya... yeh 
ek duniya nahi hai, teen duniya hai. Sab se upar swarg lok jahaan devta rehte hain, beech mein dharti lok jahaan aadmi rehte hain, aur sab se neeche paatal lok, jehaan keedey rehte hain. Waise toh ye sab shastron mein bhi likha hai...
FADE IN:
EXT. DELHI ROADS - MOVING VEHICLE - NIGHT 1.1 1.1
A police vehicle on Delhi Roads. INSPECTOR HATHI RAM 
CHAUDHARI drives it - mid 40s, with tired, cynical eyes that say he never got his due.
HATHI RAM
...Par maine watsapp pe padha.
His junior SUB INSPECTOR IMRAN ANSARI, young and hopeful at 28, nods at him and then goes back to the book in his lap.
In the back seat - CONSTABLE TOKAS and CONSTABLE BHATI 
struggle to stay awake.
HATHI RAM (CONT’D)
(referring the book)
Bas kar yaar. Abhi toh mains ka result bhi nahi aaya...
ANSARI
Sir pass ho gaya toh interview ki taiyyari toh karni hee hogi.
HATHI RAM
Aur -  matlab God forbid - fail ho gaya toh?
ANSARI
Toh agle saal ke exam ki.
Hathi Ram shakes his head.
HATHI RAM
Sun le... kuchh nahi rakha kitaabon mein. Kaam ki baat bataa raha hoon.
Ansari smiles and shuts his book. Looks at Hathi Ram with full attention."
"ANSARI
Haan Sir... wo teen lok...
HATHI RAM
Apna thana jo hai na... Outer 
Jamuna Paar... wo hai paataal lok. Wahaan kya hota hai, kaun se keedey ka murder hua, kis keedey ki cycle chori hui, kis ne beewi ko peet diya, kisi ko ghanta farak nahi padta. Tum karte raho investigate, koi promotion nahi milna.
ANSARI
Toh matlab Lutyens’ Delhi mein posting milni chahiye thhi... Ashoka Road, Aurangzeb Road... swarg lok toh wahi hua na?
Hathi Ram smiles.
HATHI RAM
Beta swarg lok mein jo case hota hai na, wo wahin dabaa diya jaata hai... toh police wala kya investigate karega aur kya number kamaayega?
The WIRELESS in the car spurts to life.
VOICE ON WIRELESS (O.S.)
Shakurpuri JJ colony se maar peet ki complaint aayi hai... aas paas ke PCR van zara ek chakkar maar lein...
Ansari increases the volume. Hathi Ram sighs. 
EXT. DELHI SLUMS - NIGHT 1.2 1.2
The constables lead the way, one of them shining a torch 
light on the dimly lit meandering lanes.
Hathi Ram and Ansari follow, while a dog comes after them, 
barking incessantly.
HATHI RAM
Vasant Vihar, Preet Vihar, Mehrauli, Noida... Yeh sab hai dharti lok, jahaan kabhi kabhi paatal lok ke keedey ghus aate hain aur dharti lok waale aadmiyon ko kaat dete hain.
Hathi Ram’s foot lands on something. He stops to look.
Damn - a turd, remnants of which now stick to his shoe.2."
"A disgusted Hathi Ram tries to wipe it away on the side wall. 
One of the constables turns to look. The other flashes his 
torch light.
An embarrassed Hathi Ram gives up and resumes his walk.
HATHI RAM (CONT’D)
Aur in ke kaatne se hota hai kaand. 
Arushi kaand, Nithari kaand, BMW kaand, falaa kaand, dhimka kaand... Aur police waale ko number sirf kaand investigate karne ke milte hain. Samjha?
ANSARI
Sir aise thodi hota hai...
HATHI RAM
Bharti hue kitne maheene hue?
ANSARI
Er, teen maheene Sir. *
HATHI RAM
Satrah saal ho gaye paataal lok mein... maan le.
VOICES - Up ahead in the darkness. They take a turn and reach-
A cluster of huts. A little crowd gathered outside. And 
occupying the centerstage -
A WOMAN with a bleeding head. And a DRUNK MAN beating her. 
Both hurling the choicest ABUSES at each other.
An NGO TYPE SLUM RESIDENT spots the police team. She hurries 
in their direction.
NGO WOMAN IN THE SLUM
Maine hee phone kiya sir. Dekho kaise peet raha hai. Roz ki baat hai.
The constables try to separate the man from the woman.
But the man’s drunk out of his wits. He just won’t let go.Ansari intervenes. Slaps the man. The drunk man tries to hit 
Ansari back.
The constables let loose their danda. Thrash the man.The woman - crying and abusing the husband so far - now turns 
around and comes after Ansari and the constables.Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 3."
"SLUM WOMAN
Maadarchod... mere marad ko 
maarega?
Hathi Ram stands there - surveying the scene with the boredom 
of someone who has seen it one time too many.
He casts a weary look around.A LITTLE CROWD of watchers stand or squat around, scratching 
their balls and smoking their beedis. Tired, hopeless faces, 
watching the scene with an equal disinterest. A naked kid - presumably the fighting couple’s - howls closeby, unattended.
Hathi Ram sniffs. Smells something foul. Oh - the shoe!The disgust returns to his face as he tries to clean it on 
the ground. But - the damn thing is sticky!
O.S., the foul-mouthed woman rages on-
SLUM WOMAN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Sadegi teri laash kuttey... keedey 
khaayenge tere ko, keedey...
INT. HOTEL UPTOWN - CORRIDOR + ROOM #1 - DAY 1.3 1.3
CLOSE ON a cockroach. The antennae gently swing about. Only 
for a short bit though as -
CRUNCH! A foot comes to land on it.It’s a WAITER walking down a long hotel corridor, holding a 
tray.
He stifles a yawn. Clearly, it’s rather early in the morning.A gaudily dressed WOMAN passes him by in the corridor - 
clearly a hooker. Yeah, it’s that kind of a hotel.
He checks out her ass before stopping outside a room. Checks 
the room number on the bill.
He hears - AN AGITATED VOICE come from inside the room. The waiter gets curious. Brings his ear close to the door. 
Listens on.
AGITATED VOICE (O.S.)
Mujhe bas Masterji se baat karni hai... wo toh teen din se sun raha hoon, meri baat Masterji se karwaao...
A loud GRUNT comes from inside, like the phone has been angrily cut. The waiter has still got his ear to the door straining to hear further -4."
"When - the door opens in a FLASH, startling him.
The flashy CHAAKU, 25, stands there - cheap sunglasses, a 
cigarette dangling from his lips. A bad boy cliché.
He glares at the awkward waiter, who mumbles a - 
CURIOUS WAITER
Er... order.
CHAAKU
Cancel.
The waiter wants to protest but Chaaku continues to glare at 
him from behind the sunglasses. The waiter scurries away.
Chaaku watches him go. Then turns around to go back in the 
room, we see stuffed behind the back of his jeans - a gun.
Chaaku walks up to the table on which lies - a bright yellow 
phone. Chaaku picks it up and looks towards -
The chair. On which sits - TYAGI, 30 - eyes shut, massaging 
his head with a chilled water bottle.
INT. HOTEL UPTOWN - ROOM #2 - DAY 1.4 1.4
Another room. A young man with the eyes of a drifter - KABIR, 
27 - sits whittling away at something with a pen knife. As he finishes up, we realize - it's a wooden CHOOZA (chick).
He checks it from all angles. He seems satisfied with it.
INT. HOTEL UPTOWN - ROOM #2 - BATHROOM - DAY 1.5 1.5
A pretty girl with North eastern features, 22, sits on the 
commode, peeing. We'll call her CHEENI.
Just then - A knock on the door.She quickly finishes up, pulls up her jeans and opens the 
door to see - 
Kabir standing there. In his hand - the chooza. He offers it 
to her.
Cheeni looks at him weirdly. Then takes it, unsure what to 
make of the gesture.
An awkward moment. Finally broken by - the doorbell.Kabir opens the door. It’s Chaaku standing there.
CHAAKU
Chalo.5."
"The two look at him.
INT. HOTEL UPTOWN - CORRIDOR - DAY 1.6 1.6
The long, musty corridor. A tube light flickers.
The four walk - a bag in the hands of each one of them.Something odd about the group.
EXT. HOTEL UPTOWN - DAY 1.7 1.7
The four emerge out of the hotel - head towards a parked SUV.
Kabir opens the boot. Just as they are depositing their bags 
in it -
The curious waiter from earlier comes running with a bill. 
CURIOUS WAITER
Wo cancel order bill mein  nahi joda 
thha.
Chaaku turns. Lights up a ciggarette while glaring at him -
CHAAKU
Cancel order hai na? Toh bill mein 
kyun judega?
CURIOUS WAITER
(protests)
Par ban toh gaya thha na...
CHAAKU
Banne se kya? Maine khaaya thodi...
CURIOUS WAITER
Mujhe nahi pata. Aap manager se 
baat karo - 
Chaaku moves towards him threateningly but -
Tyagi takes out some money and gives it to the waiter.Chaaku doesn't like it. He turns to stare at Tyagi - Who quietly goes and sits down in the back seat of the SUV.Cheeni joins him there. As Kabir takes the driver’s seat - a 
grumbling Chaaku jumps up front with him.
They drive away.The waiter mumbles angrily as he watches them go.Then he turns around to go back to the hotel.6."
"We STAY ON THE FRAME. 
Early morning. Not much activity around. But soon enough -TWO CARS screech to a stop outside the hotel.7-8 MEN jump out.And run straight into the hotel. Suddenly - it's all very 
FRANTIC.
WE STAY ON THE FRAME some more as -Soon enough, the men come out running - tentatively followed 
by the nervous waiter.
The waiter points in the direction the SUV carrying the four 
had gone in. The men scramble back into their two cars and blitz away in that direction.
EXT. DELHI ROADS - MOVING CARS - DAY 1.8 1.8
The two cars drive like mad on the streets, zipping past 
vehicles.
The men inside scan the road with desperate eyes. A man in 
his mid 40s looks like THE LEADER as he orders the driver to -
THE LEADER
Chal chal bhagaa... Fast...
Finally he spots - an SUV. It’s the one in which the four of them left.
THE LEADER (CONT’D)
Wo rahe... chal aage le...
As the car moves towards the SUV -
The leader unlocks his gun and look at the rest - who too 
bring their guns out.
THE LEADER (CONT’D)
Tu overtake kar ke raasta block kar. Unko peechhe se dabaane de.
As they move ahead, the leader signals the same to the men in the other car with them - we’re overtaking.
The men nod - got it.
THE SUV:
It drives at an easy pace - they seem to have no inkling.The first car slowly gets closer to them.7."
"And closer. Almost there.
But just as the car tries to overtake them from the wrong 
side, Chaaku notices it.
His eyes go to - The men. Something’s wrong. He taps at Kabir’s shoulder - 
CHAAKU
Gaadi aage le!
Kabir looks at him. He too notices the car, now driving 
alongside them.
The men in the car realize they’ve been spotted. They try to 
keep their cool as they overtake.
And then Chaaku notices - a gun. He SCREAMS -
CHAAKU (CONT’D)
BHAGAA BHENCHOD!
A nervous Kabir HITS the accelerator and they manage to zoom 
ahead just in time.
A CRAZY CHASE ensues. Kabir's an expert at maneuvering the SUV through the traffic - 
but the lead car just won’t let it get out of sight.
Honks. Screeches. The traffic goes nuts as they dangerously 
zig zag their way around it.
Cheeni lets out a shriek as Kabir makes a particularly 
dangerous maneuvre. She holds on to the seat tight - looking increasingly worried. *
Kabir realizes - the lead car’s trying to overtake the SUV *
from the other lane. He zips up his pace further and *
deliberately blocks its path every time it tries to get *
ahead. *
But at one moment - he gets stuck behind a slow moving auto *
rickshaw. *
Kabir HONKS at the rickshaw. Chaaku leans out of the car *
window, SHOUTING - *
CHAAKU (CONT’D) *
ABEY HATT MAADARCHOD! *
Kabir tries to get out of the lane and overtake - *
But - there’s a car to the right and Kabir doesn’t have *
enough gap to make the move. *Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 8."
"Just the opening the lead car was looking for. It makes a *
sharp maneuvre and manages to overtake the SUV in one swift *
move. *
EXT. YAMUNA BRIDGE - DAY 1.9 1.9
Up ahead - a bridge. *
Having gone ahead, the lead car makes a sharp skid and stops 
in a way so to block the road.
Vehicles behind slam their brakes. The auto crashes into the 
car.
Fuck. Kabir too brakes hard - managing to stop only about 
hundred meters or so before the lead car.
They see - men jump out with guns.Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
KABIR
Ye... ye log kaun hain?
They look at each other - confused. Until - 
CHAAKU
PEECHHE LE!
Kabir’s really nervous now as he puts the car in reverse.Tyagi - tense, but trying to keep his calm.ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BRIDGE:
Across the divider - A media OB Van approaching from the 
other direction notices the SUV blocking the road.
The DRIVER slows down out of curiosity. The CAMERAMAN peeps 
out too.
CAMERAMAN
Arey kya bhasudi pe gayi?
Then he spots - the men with the guns.
CAMERAMAN (CONT’D)
O BHENCHOD!!!
He grabs at his camera.
WHILE ON THIS SIDE:
The men - making their way towards the SUV.Kabir - trying to reverse. The onslaught of the oncoming 
vehicles coming at them.Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 9."
"Honks. Screeching of brakes.
A mini truck comes to a screeching halt right behind, 
starting a cascading effect of screeching brakes behind it.
And in front of their SUV - the jumble of cars.Damn - they're stuck.Kabir panics. Cheeni begins to scream and cry.Chaaku and Tyagi jump out of the SUV.They run to the back of the car. Realize - the boot's locked.Chaaku bangs on the car, screaming -
CHAAKU
DICKEY KHOL!
They fail to notice that somewhere behind the mini truck that 
has stopped behind them - is the other car that was chasing them.
And four men with guns jump out of it and rush towards the 
SUV.
The men in front:
 They’re almost at the SUV. And just then, 
the leader notices -The media OB van across the divider. And a cameraman trying 
to get the best possible shot of the action.
Damn. He can’t believe his fucking luck.
THE LEADER
Bhenchod!
He SHOUTS OUT at one of his men - 
THE LEADER (CONT’D)
DAHIYA! DAHIYA!
The man turns to look at him. Then follows his gaze. To see - The media van. He too seems unsettled at the sight.AT THE SUV:
The open boot. Chaaku and Tyagi scramble through the luggage.Chaaku notices - the men in front are almost upon them.He makes a dash. The men coming from the front chase him, and 
so do the ones behind.
Then the men realize - too many of them are chasing Chaaku 
alone while the other three have been left free.10."
"Some of the men now turn around and go for the other three.
Confusion. Chaos.The leader SHOUTS out at his men in frustration - 
THE LEADER (CONT’D)
AARAAM SE... KOI GOLI NAHI 
CHALAAYEGA...
Shouts. Honks.
The Camera Man happily shoots it all.AT THE SUV:
Tyagi - rummaging through his bag. Finds - the gun.But just as he is about to bring it out - Two men come from behind and grab him.He resists. They pin him down to the ground - face down.Men surround the SUV with Kabir and Cheeni still inside.Cheeni looks from inside the car - The angry men. Their guns 
pointed at her.
She begins to SHAKE. And SCREAM.The men SHOUT at her - 
MAN WITH GUN
HAATH UPAR! HAATH UPAR!
She does as told. And so does Kabir.The men open the doors and pull Kabir and Cheeni out at gun 
point.
ON THE BRIDGE:
The traffic jam of jumbled up vehicles. The men chase Chaaku 
through it.
Chaaku jumps over a car hood. The men follow. As the men chase Chaaku, trampling all over car hoods and 
roofs -
Some commuters shoot videos on their mobiles, while others 
SCREAM -
CAR OWNER ON THE BRIDGE
Bhonsdi ke nayi gaadi hai, dent pad jaayega...11."
"Chaaku’s giving the men a tough time - proving difficult to 
be caught.
But there’re three of them and finally they manage to co-
ordinate between themselves just enough to corner him - 
Right over a car roof.Chaaku knows his game is up. He suddenly remembers something.He yanks that bright yellow phone out of his pocket. The men realize what he’s up to.As Chaaku tries to throw away his phone - The men try to grab 
his arm. An almost comical sort of a tussle ensues.
The ONLOOKERS watch with excitement as Chaaku suddenly 
remembers that his other hand is free. He transfers the phone to his free hand and swing it with all his might.
And with this everything goes SLO MO - The heads of the onlookers turn and their mouths go wide open 
as if they’re following the trajectory of a cricket ball going out of the stadium as -
The phone COASTS THROUGH in the air. Off the bridge.UNDERWATER SHOT - Looking at the skies. From where the phone 
comes flying. Right towards the camera. And just before it can hit the waters - 
EXT. DELHI ROAD - TEA STALL - DAY 1.10 1.10
SPLASH! The hit of water. The Drunk Man comes to.
Looks around in confusion. He is on his knees on the ground, 
right next to the parked police car.
Notices - Hathi Ram staring at him, while sipping his tea.Slowly - realization dawns upon him. He begins to beg.The wireless in the car cackles -
VOICE ON WIRELESS (O.S.)
Jamuna bridge pe badi vardaat... 
sabhi PCR van ko soochit kiya jaata hai... Jamuna Bridge pe badi vardaat...
Ansari looks at Hathi Ram. Hathi Ram signals - ‘let’s go’.
ANSARI
Is ka kya karein?12."
"Hathi Ram pulls the man up. Slaps him.
HATHI RAM
Karega fir se?
DRUNK MAN
Nahi saab, nahi... maa kasam nahi.
HATHI RAM
Chal, dus uthak baithak kar.
The man holds his ears and starts with the sit ups. While -  
The cops jump into the car and drive away.The man watches them go. Stops. Only to see Hathi Ram stick 
his head out from the vehicle to look back at him.
The man quickly resumes the sit ups.
EXT. YAMUNA BRIDGE - DAY 1.11 1.11
The handheld Camera POV of the OB van Cameraman:
The bridge has turned into a theatre by now. People are out 
of their cars, shooting videos on their mobiles. Pushing and shoving, honking and shouting - it’s all happening here.
And all of it to get a better view of - the captured four - 
now on their knees, being held at gun point.
The crowd is being pushed back by the gun men who have got 
their I-cards out of their pockets by now.
MAN WITH GUN
Peechhe hato... Delhi police... peechhe hato.
It's now that we realize that these men are cops. The leader - a tense DCP BHAGAT - is on a phone call - trying hard to hear *
over the noise.
The situation looks like going out of hand. Just then -Someone pushes his way through the crowd - it's Hathi Ram, 
with Ansari and the constables.
Hathi Ram approaches one of the cops. Notices the I-Card - 
Delhi Police, Intelligence .
Hathi Ram salutes. The cop points at DCP Bhagat who’s on the *
phone a little away- 
COP ON THE BRIDGE
DCP Bhagat, headquarter se. *Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 13."
"HATHI RAM
Inspector Hathi Ram Chaudhary 
Sir... Outer Jamuna Paar thaana. Ye area hamaare thaane ke under padta hai.
The cop looks at him.
COP ON THE BRIDGE
Bheed ko control mein laao.
Hathi Ram signals his team to get the crowd in order. Ansari and the constables stage a mini lathi charge - pushing the crowd back.
Hathi Ram watches as the cop he spoke to walks up to DCP *
Bhagat and briefs him.
Bhagat looks at Hathi Ram as he finishes up his call. Then he 
marches up to Hathi Ram - who offers a crisp salute.
DCP BHAGAT *
Chaudhary... in chaaron ka arrest procedure shuru karo. Tumhaare thaane mein.
Hathi Ram’s eyes go to the four - the odd bunch on their knees. Their eyes - looking right back at him.
HATHI RAM
Sir. Charge kya rahega?
Before DCP Bhagat can reply - A SUDDEN ROAR. *
Hathi Ram looks - The crowd has got too close for police’s comfort and another lathi charge is being resorted to.
Screams. Shouts. Chaos. Noise. And then - 
INT. NEWS NOW OFFICE - SANJEEV’S CABIN - DAY 1.12 1.12
ABRUPT silence. Just a tick-tock-tick of a clock on the wall.
TWO LAWYERS in crisp black suits. One of them leafs through a 
contract while speaking -
LAWYER ONE
Of course, since the minimum term of five years has not been completed before the contract is being terminated, you shall be eligible for a severance bonus equivalent of the remaining salary. 
(MORE)Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 14."
"And you’d still have a cashing out 
option on the five percent equity stake that was to be transferred to you at the completion of five years. As you can see, Singh saab is being more than fair with his revised offer.
Sitting in front of them - SANJEEV MEHRA, 40, sophisticated, charming. But that’s on a good day. At this point - he seems a bit on the edge as he sits next to JAI MALIK, about 40 himself.
SANJEEV
I guess I’ll have to repeat what I said in the last meeting - I’m not resigning. I’ve given four years to this damn channel... built it from scratch. And if he thinks he can just throw me out -
LAWYER ONE
It’s nothing personal, sir. Singh saab is just going by the performance of the chann-
SANJEEV
(cuts him; snaps)
Your Singh saab can go fuck himself.
Jai looks at Sanjeev sharply. Then glances at the lawyers awkwardly.
JAI
Er, can you give us a few minutes, Rajeev? I’ll send some fresh coffee in the conference room.
As the lawyers sigh and walk out, Jai turns to Sanjeev.
JAI (CONT’D)
It’s not just the TRPs. Singh ko kuchh aur bhi pata hai.
Sanjeev looks at him. Jai hesitates before - 
JAI (CONT’D)
That you’ve been looking for dirt on their Delhi-Sonipat Expressway deal.
Sanjeev - rather startled to hear that.
JAI (CONT’D)
Singh is not the guy you mess with, Sanjeev.LAWYER ONE (CONT'D)
15."
"A tense Sanjeev stares at him with unease.
EXT. JAMUNA PAAR POLICE STATION - DAY 1.13 1.13
Hathi Ram’s police jeep, followed by the two unmarked cars of *
Delhi Police Intelligence. And behind them - a few OB vans. *
It’s a full circus. *
A few kids playing with toy guns watch them go and ‘shoot’ at *
them. *
INT. JAMUNA PAAR POLICE STATION - DAY 1.14 1.14*
KABIR
Kabir M.
HEAD CONSTABLE TOKAS looks up from the record book. *
TOKAS
M kya? Poora bol.
KABIR
Bas M hee hai saab.
Bhati chips in from behind - 
CONSTABLE BHATI
Madrasi? Wo hee log likhte hain 
aise...
TOKAS
Chal kapde utaar.
(to Bhati)
Talashi le iski...
As Kabir reluctantly takes his clothes off and Bhati strip searches him and checks his clothes - 
Tokas looks at Chaaku and Tyagi.
TOKAS (CONT’D)
Naam.
The two - quiet.
TOKAS (CONT’D)
Poora din nahi hai mere paas.
Still no response. Tokas glares at them. Chaaku holds his gaze.Tokas gets up. Goes behind them.The two sit tight - sensing the presence behind. But Tokas 
seems to be doing nothing.Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 16."
"Until all of a sudden - Tokas grabs their heads and bangs 
them against each other.
A sharp joint SCREAM as the two hold their heads in pain.As Tokas goes to grab them again - Ansari comes rushing.
ANSARI
Kya kar rahe ho, Tokas? Sir log 
hain andar, baahar media hai...
We can sense that Tokas doesn’t quite like the reprimand by the much younger but officially his superior Ansari.
TOKAS
Aise hee bulwaana padta hai... Sir
.
Ansari gives him a look. Tokas holds firm.
TOKAS (CONT’D)
Naam tak nahi bataaya ab tak...
Beat. Ansari turns to Chaaku.
He pulls Chaaku up - who resists, glaring at Ansari with an 
intense hostility.
But Ansari pins him to the wall, and checks his pockets.Finally - he finds something. A wallet.Ansari checks it. In it - a DRIVING LICENSE. On it - Chaaku’s 
photo with his name - TOPE SINGH.
Ansari hands it over to a sheepish Tokas and walks away.Bhati laughs as he hits on the back of Chaaku’s head.
BHATI
Chutiya! Bekaar mein pita!
INT. JAMUNA PAAR POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY 1.15 1.15*
An excited lady constable, MANJU VERMA, escorts Cheeni to the 
Interrogation Room while chatting on the phone. *
MANJU VERMA
(into the phone)
Haan Mummy ka bhi phone aaya Meerut se, Mummy boli - 
(to Cheeni)
Chal kapde utaar...
Cheeni begs in protest. Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 17."
"CHEENI
Madam maine kuchh nahi kiya. 
Shoppers Zone Mall mein kaam karti hoon. In logon se bas lift li thhi - 
Manju Verma slaps her and signals her to start stripping.
MANJU VERMA
(into the phone)
Toh mummy bol rahi thhi tera thaana dikha rahe hain TV pe, baahar aa ke haath hilaa de camera ko... maine bola mummy IPL ka match thodi hai...
She throws a look at Cheeni - who still has her clothes on. Manju Verma angrily pulls at her hair and her clothes -
MANJU VERMA (CONT’D)
Khol... khol randi...
(into the phone)
Nahi unka gathiya toh theek hai kuchh dinon se. Homeopathy khaa rahi hai...
A sobbing Cheeni finally gives in. Tentatively takes off her t-shirt and her jeans.
She stands ashamed - trying to cover herself with her arms - While Manju Verma cursorily checks her jeans and t-shirt.
MANJU VERMA (CONT’D)
(into the phone)
Par ladies waali problem ho rakhi 
hai us se... Arey badi garam karti hai ye dawaaiyaan...
And then throws the clothes back at Cheeni.
MANJU VERMA (CONT’D)
(into the phone)
Aur kya dikha rahe hain TV pe?
INT. JAMUNA PAAR POLICE STATION - SHO’S CABIN - DAY 1.16 1.16
EXT. YAMUNA BRIDGE - DAY 1.16INS 1.16INS
ON a TV as it plays on loop the video of Chaaku's phone being thrown in the Yamuna, complete in super slo mo glory.
TV REPORTER (V.O.)

"aur ye gaya phone Yamuna ji ki god

Watching it is SHO VIRK, in his 40s , who heads this station. *
He looks rather flustered.
SHO VIRK
(mutters)
Abhi aana thha case... 
Hathi Ram - standing next to him - overhears. And pitches in -
HATHI RAM
Ho jaayega, sir. Main sambhaal loonga...
Virk seems unconvinced. He looks towards DCP Bhagat - who is *
on a phone call a little away.
A LITTLE AWAY:
Bhagat - his eyes on Hathi Ram - finishes his phone call. Virk approaches him.
DCP BHAGAT *
Haan, Virk. Ye case kaun dekhne 
waala hai?
SHO VIRK
Vikrant Bahl, Sir. 
(nervous)
Bas wo ek hafte zara chhutti par hai, aate hee charge -
Bhagat throws a glance at Hathi Ram - 
DCP BHAGAT *
Investigation hafte se delay nahi kar sakte. Arrest Chaudhary ne kiya hai... Let him handle it.
FROM A CORNER:
 Hathi Ram keenly watches the two. The way 
they’re glancing at him, he can sense they’re discussing him.
BACK WITH BHAGAT:
SHO VIRK
(hesitates)
Sir Chaudhary se nahi ho paayega. 
Case bada hai... aur usey koi experience nahi hai investigation ka...TV REPORTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 19."
"DCP BHAGAT *

SHO VIRK
Sir.
BACK WITH HATHI RAM:
 His eyes are on Bhagat. He notices -
Bhagat shouts out to one of his men we earlier saw on the bridge - OFFICER DAHIYA.
DCP BHAGAT *
Dahiya! Brief Chaudhary.
Hathi Ram beams. But tries to not let it show.
As Bhagat makes another phone call -Dahiya walks up to Hathi Ram, who quickly opens his diary.
HATHI RAM
Sir phone kahaan se aaya thha?
OFFICER DAHIYA
Anonymous thha. Munirka ke kisi PCO 
se. 
HATHI RAM
Aur tip kya thhi Sir?
OFFICER DAHIYA
Zyaada kuchh nahi. Bas yehi ki chaar aadmi murder ke iraade se Hotel Uptown mein ruke hain.
Hathi Ram waits for more. Looks like that’s all Dahiya’s got. Hathi Ram notes down ‘Hotel Uptown’ in his diary, thinking.
HATHI RAM
Tip dene waale ko ye information kahaan se mili hogi? Ki murder karne waale hain...
He looks at Dahiya.
OFFICER DAHIYA
Ho sakta hai inhi ke gang ka koi ho? Yaa fir hotel ya uske aas paas se koi waiter wagairah jisne kuchh sun dekh liya ho...
(condescending smile)
Ab kuchh toh tum bhi investigate kar lena dost.Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 20."
"Hathi Ram takes it on his chin. Smiles back. There’s still 
something on his mind though.
HATHI RAM
Sir normally toh intelligence department aisi raid ki information local thaane ko pass karta hai na?
Dahiya fixes him with a long gaze.
Just then - DCP Bhagat joins them. Dahiya smirks - *
OFFICER DAHIYA
Sir Inspector Hathi Ram Chaudhary 
ko lagta hai humne direct raid maar ke protocol break kiya.
HATHI RAM
(awkward)
Nahi Sir... main toh wo...
DCP BHAGAT *
You’re right. Par hamaare paas itna time nahi thha. Tip dene waale ne kahaa thha aaj hee ka plan hai. Toh khud direct action lena pada. Par jab tak hotel mein raid maari, ye murder karne nikal pade thhe. Humne peechha kiya aur bridge pe ghera.
HATHI RAM
Sir murder kiska karne waale thhe?
DCP Bhagat looks at him. A moment passes. And just when he is *
about to speak, we CUT TO -
INT. NEWS NOW OFFICE - CORRIDOR - DAY 1.17 1.17
A Television. A new news story being ‘broken’ on it. The 
EMPLOYEES around seem to be reacting to it. SARA MATTHEWS, *
28, is one of them (we’ll meet her again later). *
We catch an anxious-looking SECRETARY TYPE as she rushes down the corridor.
INT. NEWS NOW OFFICE - SANJEEV’S CABIN - DAY 1.18 1.18
Jai gets up and looks at Sanjeev.
JAI
I’ll ask the lawyers to reschedule. 
Thoda soch le, before taking your next step.
A phone in the room starts ringing. Sanjeev ignores it as he *
looks at Jai accusingly. *Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 21."
"SANJEEV
So you too want me to quit.
JAI
(awkward)
All I’m saying is you don’t have 
too many friends left in this town. The last thing you want is another powerful enemy.
An uneasy silence between the two. Another phone begins to *
ring. And just then - the Secretary barges in. *
JAI’S SECRETARY
Sir, you really need to see this.
She rushes to the television and switches it on.
ON THE TELEVISION
:
EXT. JAMUNA PAAR POLICE STATION - DAY 1.18INS 1.18INS
A news report plays - a journalist stands facing the camera *
with the Outer Jamuna Paar police station in the bg. *
JOURNALIST (T.V.)
After a dramatic chase, a team of *
Delhi Police Intelligence managed *
to catch the four accused who are *
now locked up in this very police *
station. The police refuses to *
disclose further but our sources in 
the police department have revealed that the target of this failed assassination attempt could’ve been journalist Sanjeev Mehra...
Sanjeev and Jai stare at the TV with their mouths open.
Sanjeev feels something and looks down at his hand. It’s 
shaking.
Jai finally turns to the ringing landline and picks it up - *
his eyes still on the TV.
JAI
Hello?
He listens on. Then suddenly gets attentive. And cups the 
mouthpiece.
JAI (CONT’D)
(to Sanjeev)
It’s the Police Commissioner.
He offers the phone to Sanjeev - Who just stands there stunned.Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 22."

baad dekhte hain.
HATHI RAM
Sir.
DCP BHAGAT *
Ye case khatam hone tak tum directly mujhe report karoge. SHO se main baat kar loonga.
Hathi Ram - surprised. Pleasantly surprised.
DCP BHAGAT (CONT’D) *
And I want daily reporting.
HATHI RAM
Jee Sir, bilkul.
INT. JAMUNA PAAR POLICE STATION - DAY 1.20 1.20
The four stand holding a slate each, with their names. We TRACK ALONG the names ‘Mary Lyngdoh’, ‘Kabir M’ and ‘Tope Singh’ until we reach - a blank slate.
Hathi Ram looks up from the blank slate to Tyagi.
HATHI RAM
Iski slate khaali kyun hai?
TOKAS
Chutiye ne naam nahi bataaya ab 
tak! Fingerprint bhi nau hee diye. 
(to Tyagi)
Ae goongey, dikha toh saahab ko.
Tyagi does as told - he spreads his fingers out in front of his face, almost in an eerie sort of fashion. Only a stub exists in place of the left thumb.
Hathi Ram walks up to him. Grabs him by his mouth.Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 23."
"Tyagi doesn’t react at all.
HATHI RAM
Yehaan goongey bhi bolte hain beta. 
Magistrate ki peshi ho jaane de, uske baad sab bulwaaunga.
He looks at the other three - Cheeni and Kabir quietly sob. *
HATHI RAM (CONT’D)
Naam bata iska.
As Chaaku stares at him with defiance -
TOKAS
Apna hee nahi bata raha tha saab. Hoshiyari chod raha hai bas.
HATHI RAM
Nahi batayega? Chal ye bata phone kyun phenka.
CHAAKU
Kaun sa phone? Maine koi phone nahi phenka.
HATHI RAM
TV pe dikha rahe hain chutiye...
Chaaku looks him in the eye.
CHAAKU
TV waale toh kuchh bhi dikhaate hain saab...
TOKAS
Dekha saab, dekha...
Hathi Ram glares at Chaaku. This one's going to be difficult, he can see. Just then - Ansari walks up to him.
ANSARI
Sir panchnama ho gaya. Evidence list ready hai.
INT. JAMUNA PAAR POLICE STATION - EVIDENCE ROOM - DAY 1.21 1.21
A cramped room piled to the top with sacks and trunks. It’s the evidence room but really, it’s just a glorified godown.
The overworked INCHARGE shows Hathi Ram the entries in his 
thick log book as Ansari points to the captured evidence spread out on the desk -
Four bags. Two guns. A pen knife.Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 24."
"ANSARI
Saamaan mein ye Glock 17 pistol, 
aur ye Bruni 8 mm mili hai. *
Fingerprint ke liye bhej rahe hain.
Hathi Ram nods. Ansari then points to a few 20-dollars bills and a ‘girly’ phone.
ANSARI (CONT’D)
Ye dollar us ladki ke paas se mile hain. Aur ye phone bhi.
HATHI RAM
Is number ki detail nikaalo. Incoming outgoing bhi check karo.
As Hathi Ram signs the log book, his eyes go to a shelf. A PLASTIC JAR, with a FOETUS inside.
EVIDENCE ROOM INCHARGE
Nursing home mein mila hai sir... wo bachcha giraane ke case mein.
Just then - something scurries past Hathi Ram’s legs before disappearing in the mess the room is. It’s a rat.
HATHI RAM
Pest control karwa le Rajpal. Evidence khaa gaye na toh fir enquiry lag jaani hai teri. *
His eyes go to - a wooden ‘chooza’ on the table. *
HATHI RAM (CONT’D) *
Ye kalaakaar kaun hai? *
ANSARI
Wo Kabir. Ek ajeeb sa medical *
certificate bhi mila hai uske paas *
se. *
He hands Hathi Ram a laminated sheet of paper. It’s an old *
certificate by a doctor stating that ‘the circumcision on Kabir M has been performed due to medical reasons’.
HATHI RAM
Gaadi yehi chala raha tha na?
Ansari nods.
ANSARI
Churaayi hui lagti hai. Number *
plate aur chassis detail match nahi *
kar rahe. Muzaffarnagar RTO se *
owner detail nikaal rahe hain. *
Hathi Ram’s eyes go to - the driving licence of Chaaku, with *
his name and address on it.Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 25."

A NEWS SCRIPT lying on the table. We glance at it - 
“There've been some rumours floating around since this 
morning. I'm here to tell you that I’m fine...”
A tense Sanjeev sits alone, smoking. His eyes go to - the 
large mirror in front. 
He stares at himself for a while. Then picks up his phone. 
Checks his Twitter feed.
INSERT TEXT:
@therealpatriot - Really sad 2 hear bout Sanjeev Mehra’s 
assassination attempt. I mean why stop at attempt ;) #Deathtopresstitutes
And the likes. Brutal, like only Twitter can be. Sanjeev 
stares at the tweets with a tired, defeated look on his face.
A knock on the door. Sanjeev looks up.Jai enters, followed by the Executive Producer, KEERTI.
SANJEEV
I don’t feel like going on air 
tonight.
Jai looks at Sanjeev’s tense face. Then at the over-flowing ash-tray in front of him.
JAI
Of course. I understand.
Sanjeev picks up the script.
SANJEEV
And we can’t run this. Police ne kuchh confirm nahi kiya hai. Commissioner ne phone pe kya kaha? ‘He’ll get back when he has something concrete’. If we run this now and it turns out to be false, we’re going to look like chuts.
JAI
I know. But it’s the top story tonight on every other channel. We don’t want to miss out on it.26."
"SANJEEV
(curt)
Last I checked, I was the one 
making editorial decisions around here.
An awkward beat.
JAI
Of course.
(to Keerti)
Ask Gayatri to take over 9 pm. And tell her we aren’t running this story.
Keerti runs out. Jai puts a hand over Sanjeev’s shoulder.
JAI (CONT’D)
Been a rough day. Chal tujhe ghar chhod deta hoon.
EXT. NEWS NOW OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT 1.23 1.23
Jai drives, with Sanjeev next to him. And all around the car - *
the clamour of journalists trying to get a byte from Sanjeev.
As Jai negotiates his way out of there - *
Sanjeev’s phone rings. He looks at it. Dolly calling...
Sanjeev shuts his eyes. Takes a tired deep breath. And then 
he picks up the phone -
SANJEEV
(into the phone)
Hello... I told you I'm fine... haan ghar hee aa raha hoon... On my way, baba.
Sanjeev cuts it just as the car manages to drive away.

"JAI (CONT’D)
Who are these people?
SANJEEV
They’re us.
Jai shakes his head in disbelief and step on the gas. *
Their fancy car zips ahead - quickly leaving behind the 
disappointed paparazzi on the rickety bike.
SANJEEV (CONT’D)
Kya lag raha hai? Kaun ho sakta hai iske peechhey?
The question hangs in the air for a while. Sanjeev susses Jai, before hinting further -
SANJEEV (CONT’D)
Singh saab?
Jai looks sharply at him.
JAI
Isn’t that taking it too far?
SANJEEV
Tune hee toh kaha tha... he’s not the guy you mess with.
JAI
Maybe it’s Dashrath Kumar.
Sanjeev shakes his head - unsure.
SANJEEV
I doubt. Us baat ko toh teen saal ho gaye hain...
JAI
Snakes and politicians - They never forget. After all - uska political career khatam kiya thha tune...
Sanjeev observes Jai as he shifts uncomfortably in his seat.

Hathi Ram finishes up his drink. He pours another one for himself from the quarter of cheap rum, while signaling Ansari *
to catch up.

Ansari looks at Hathi Ram. Then tentatively broaches a topic -

HATHI RAM

Dolly lets out a little SHRIEK as her phone and the bowl *
drops from her hands, creating a mess on the ground and on *
her night gown.She has walked right into - A circus of JOURNALISTS waiting

His phone dings. And dings. And dings. Umpteen texts from 
Dolly. ‘Where are you???’ ‘????’ ‘Please reply’
Sanjeev sends back a reply - ‘Media outside the house. 
Staying at the office tonight’.
Just then, a slightly tipsy Sara appears there.
SARA
A penguin walks into a bar, goes to 
the counter, and asks the bartender - “Have you seen my brother?”The bartender says, “I don’t know. What does he look like?”
No reaction from Sanjeev.
SARA (CONT’D)

You know... penguins... they all look the same...
She stops. She knows she’s making it worse. But thankfully -
Sanjeev finally snorts out a smile.
SANJEEV
Sara, right?
Sara smiles and nods - utterly relieved.
SARA
Sara Matthews. 6 pm feature.
SANJEEV
Looks like you haven't heard the 
breaking news tonight.
SARA
Of course I did. I just figured that if you wanted to talk about it, you wouldn't be sitting alone in a bar right now.
And at that, Sanjeev lets out a proper smile for the first time in the day.
THE BARhas emptied since. And just going by their body language, 
Sanjeev and Sara both look quite drunk.Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 33."
"SARA (CONT’D)
You know, I was in my final 
semester at Cornell when you did that Dashrath Kumar story. The sheer audacity of it... And then the next day you went to him yourself, with cameras, to break the story of the sting to him. And just what did he say to admit his guilt? One word -
(beat; play-acts it)
Bhenchod!
She laughs. Sanjeev lets out a wistful smile at the memory.
SARA (CONT’D)
That's when I decided to come back to India... to work for you.
A long pause before - 
SANJEEV
We used to be heroes, you know... people like us. And then something about this country changed. And now we get trolled. And killed. And fired.
Sara looks quite taken aback to hear that. And the moment turns somber. The Bartender appears and puts two plastic *
glasses in front of them - ‘closing time’. *
SANJEEV (CONT’D)
See, we even get thrown out of bars.
Sara lets out a half smile. And hesitates before saying -
SARA
Well, if you’re up for it, I’ve half a bottle of cheap rum at my *
place. And a couch that doesn’t ask too many questions.
Sanjeev looks at her. And smiles.

In a corner - a little wooden temple in which red and blue 
lights blink around an image of Lord Hanuman.

An old B/W picture on the wall - possibly Hathi Ram’s father.
It’s a rather depressing, windowless living room - the kind 
that has a wash basin in it.
Just as he sits down on the old sofa, Renu appears. And it’s 
only now that we really see her. She looks older than her forty years, but she’s not the kind who’ll complain about it.

Renu rolls her eyes - like it's an everyday thing.
ANGLE ON the half eaten plate of food.It lies in Hathi Ram’s lap as he sits with his eyes shut, 
getting a nice oily head massage from Renu. Going by the SOUNDS of pleasure he’s making, he seems relaxed now.

INT. SANJEEV'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM + DRIVEWAY - DAY 1.41 1.41*
Hathi Ram sits with two plain clothes policemen. Given their stoic, hard-to-read faces, let’s call them SHADOWS.
Dolly notices Sanjeev entering and rushes up to him. *
She hugs him tight. Whispers - *
DOLLY
I’m sorry.
Sanjeev notices - from across the living room - Hathi Ram’s 
watching.
SANJEEV
It’s okay, honey. I’m fine.
He gently gets out of her hug and walks up to Hathi Ram.
They shake hands.Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 39."
"HATHI RAM

Jamuna Paar Thaana.
SANJEEV

Hathi Ram looks at him with genuine admiration.
HATHI RAM
Of course, Sir. Aap ko toh kab se dekh rahe hain TV pe...
Sanjeev smiles. They sit down.
HATHI RAM (CONT’D)
Madam ne bataaya aap kal ghar nahi aaye thhe...
SANJEEV
(awkward)
Haan wo... ghar ke baahar reporters jamaa thhe... toh ek hotel mein...
Hathi Ram observes him.
HATHI RAM
Kuchh din careful rahein, Sir. Baahar jaayein toh inhe saath le ke. Aur raat ki shift ke liye ek doosri team hogi.
Sanjeev looks at the two shadows - Something unsettling about them.
HATHI RAM (CONT’D)
Waise aap ko kisi pe koi shaq?
Sanjeev shakes his head - unsure.
HATHI RAM (CONT’D)
Koi property dispute?
SANJEEV
Nahi.
HATHI RAM
Koi puraani dushmani? 
(nudging in a direction)
Koi khulaasa wagairah kiya ho aapne, kisi badey aadmi ke khilaaf... ya karne waale ho?
Sanjeev looks at him. For a moment he’s tempted to say something - but changes his mind. Shrugs.
SANJEEV
Part of the job.40."
"Hathi Ram nods. Glances at Dolly who’s instructing the maid a 
little away from them.
HATHI RAM
(softly)
Sir koi affair wagairah?
Sanjeev looks at him sharply.
HATHI RAM (CONT’D)
Routine sawaal hain Sir. Normally yehi sab wajah hoti hai murder ki. Jar Joru Jameen.
SANJEEV
Nahi aisa kuchh nahi hai.
(changing the topic)
Waise wo chaar log kaun hain... un ki koi information?
HATHI RAM
Tafteesh kar rahe hain, Sir. Aur 
aap ko police station aana padega. 
Identification ke liye...
Sanjeev nods.
EXT. SANJEEV’S HOUSE - DOORWAY - DAY 1.42 1.42*
Hathi Ram brings out his little pocket diary with the 
‘Narsingh avataar’ photo on its cover. Quite kitschy!
In it he writes - ‘Afair?’He looks at it. Something’s off.With an uncertain pen - he changes the spelling to ‘Affair?’.

"No one there.
He sees books and papers scattered all over the study desk. A 
couple of papers have fallen on the ground too.
Hathi Ram shakes his head. Then picks them up and puts them 
on the desk. Puts the books in order.
He’s about to turn away when - Something sticking out of a 
book catches his attention.
He pulls it out.It’s a marksheet. Lots of reds. And an ‘F’ at the bottom.And then his eyes spot - a signature at the bottom - ‘Hathi 
Ram Chaudhary’.
Anger rises on his face as he stares at the signature.
INT. JAMUNA PAAR POLICE STATION - NIGHT 1.46 1.46
An old printer finishes spitting out a document. *
Ansari picks it up. 
It’s the criminal record of Kabir M, along with his picture.Ansari scans through it - A long list of car jacking cases.Ansari is about to turn away when - The printer starts printing again. *
Ansari stops. Looks at it.A photograph slowly starts to emerge.Curious - Ansari bends over to peer at it.It’s an old photograph - but as more and more of it comes 
out, the face begins to resemble VISHAL TYAGI. The clincher though is the next column that emerges out -
Identification mark: Missing left thumb
.
And as the printer continues to spit out his criminal record - *
Ansari’s eyes widen with shock at what he’s reading.

HATHI RAM

A door gets SLAMMED somewhere O.S. 
Renu sighs and goes in the direction, calling out -

ANSARI

They reach - the lock up. The three male accused sit on the ground - their backs against the grimy lockup wall.
From Hathi Ram’s POV - We start a SLOW TRACK towards Tyagi as-
ANSARI
Kidnapping, Ransom, Extortion...
(beat)
Aur paintalees murder.
The TRACK stops on a TIGHT of Tyagi. He sits calm as ever - 
looking straight at us. His cold eyes - not giving away anything.
And then - just like how he did earlier - Tyagi eerily 
spreads his fingers out in front of his face -
Four fingers in one, five in another. 45."
"Four. Five. Forty five.
FADE OUT.
ROLL IN END CREDITS46."
