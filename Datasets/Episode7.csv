"ON BLACK:
SOUND of feet walking on dry leaves. Heavy breathing.
SOUNDS of nature - a bird calls somewhere. Kinda ominous.And then - a hassled HUMAN VOICE -
DOCTOR (O.S.)
Aur... aur kitni door hai maharaj?
FADE IN:
EXT. CHITRAKOOT JUNGLE - DAY 7.1 7.1
A dense jungle.
Two dangerous looking man, OM JI and FIRANGI, lead the way - *
clearing the bushes around with rifles. *
Behind him, a man who exudes power - GWALA GUJJAR, 50. He 
walks holding the hand of a timid man with a blindfold around his eyes. Based on the medical kit that the blindfolded man is carrying with him, he seems like a DOCTOR.
DOCTOR
Maharaj... ghutan si ho rahi.
The other two offer no reply - they just continue walking.
The Doctor seems rather uncomfortable.
DOCTOR (CONT’D)
Thodi der ke layi je patti hataa 
sakat hain kaa?
Still no response. The frustrated Doctor tries to take the blindfold off 
himself.
Which is when Om ji suddenly turns and puts something hard *
and cold into the doctor’s mouth. A gun.The Doctor starts to gag and lets out muffled protests in 
fear. 
Gwala puts a comforting hand over his shoulder.
GWALA GUJJAR
Bas aa gavo daagdar saab. Thoda so 
dheeraj aur rakh lo."
"The Doctor somehow calms himself down.
EXT. CHITRAKOOT JUNGLE - HIDEOUT - DAY 7.2 7.2
A little make-shift tent. A dangerous looking one-eyed goon *
in khakhis, KANA COMMANDO, 50, stands guard outside. We can’t *
see what’s inside.
As the trio reaches there, Gwala takes the Doctor’s blindfold 
off.
The Doctor’s eyes adjust to the light. And then he sees - the 
tent in front.
Gwala signals to him - ‘go ahead’. *
With tentative steps, the nervous doctor walks towards the 
tent.
We STAY ON him as he reaches up to the tent. Kana Commando *
parts the tent opening a bit. *
We still don’t see what the doctor’s looking at, but whatever *
it is makes his eyes go wide in fear and respect.He goes down on his knees. And folds his hands in reverence.His eyes on - a pair of canvas shoes that lie on the ground 
next to a cot.
CLOSE ON his face as he stares at them like a devotee staring 
at his God, and says -
DOCTOR
Masterji
!

INT. HATHI RAM’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY 7.3A 7.3A
An open bag. Clothes and accessories spread all over the bed.
It’s a hassled Hathi Ram packing his bag, and he isn’t seem 
to be doing a very neat job of it.
HATHI RAM
(mutters)
Kachche kahaan hai yaar?Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 2."
"Sid quietly watches from the bed.
Hathi Ram’s phone rings. ‘Virk calling...’ Hathi Ram ignores it, and walks to the cupboard.He looks in there. Still can’t find his underwear.
INT. HATHI RAM’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 7.3B 7.3B
The sparkling water machine seems to be an overbearing 
presence in the room as Renu sits with, for once, a subdued Jitu.
RENU
Har baar aapki wajah se problem 
mein fansi hoon...
She notices - Hathi Ram at the door.
Hathi Ram avoids eye contact with Renu as he says to her -
HATHI RAM
Wo... mere kachche nahi mil rahe.
Renu gives him a look. And then she turns back to Jitu - 
RENU
Har baar maine aap ko support kiya 
hai. Kiya hai ki nahi? Jab Papa ne 
aap ko ghar se nikaala tha toh cheh 
maheene rakha tha apne paas...
Hathi Ram sighs and goes back to the bedroom.
INT. HATHI RAM’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY 7.3C 7.3C
He finishes up - stuffing whatever is there in the bag. 
Just then - Sid comes with two underwears.
SID
Wo... rassi pe sookh rahe thhe...
They exchange an awkward smile. Hathi Ram stuffs them in the bag, zips it up and walks out 
with it.3."
"INT. HATHI RAM’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 7.3D 7.3D
He stops in front of Renu. But she ignores him and continues 
talking to Jitu - 
RENU
Sab ke baare mein sochti hoon, par kabhi kisi se koi appreciation mila hai? Le ke jaaiye apna ye kabaad...
Hathi Ram gets the message. And quietly walks out of the door.
EXT. DELHI - ISBT BUS DEPOT - DAY 7.4 7.4
Ansari’s bike comes to a stop.
Hathi Ram gets down with his bag.His phone rings. It’s Virk again.
HATHI RAM
Ye Virk kyun baar baar phone kar 
raha hai?
ANSARI
Mujhe bhi phone aaya thha... ki 
study leave pe study karo. Aur nahi 
karni, toh thaane aa jaao duty pe.
Hathi Ram frowns. And this time, answers the call.

"HATHI RAM
Sir wo dengue ka test karwaane jaa 
raha hoon...
(coughs for effect)
Call karta hoon sir...
Hathi Ram cuts the line.
ANSARI
Mujhe chalna chahiye thha aapke saath...
HATHI RAM
Study leave pe study karo.
Ansari smiles.
HATHI RAM (CONT’D)
(earnest)
Nahi toh meri tarah reh jaayega...
Ansari takes out something from the storage under the seat. His gun.
ANSARI 
Sir ye rakh lo.
HATHI RAM
Paagal hai? Naukri jaa sakti hai teri.
ANSARI
Dangerous area hai, sir. Aap duty pe bhi nahi ho. Rakh lo. Bas try karna ki chalaani na padey.
Hathi Ram smiles, and takes it.
EXT. DELHI HIGHWAY TO CHITRAKOOT - MOVING BUS - NIGHT 7.5 7.5
A pair of headlights hurtling into the unknown darkness. It’s 
a bus riding on the dark highway.
INSIDE THE BUS
: A sleepless Hathi Ram sits flipping through 
his notebook.Names stare back at him - Chanda, Chitrakoot, Gwala Gujjar, 
Masterji, Rajbir Gujjar, Bajpayee...And just then - A SCREEEEECH followed by a THUDDDDDD!Startled PASSENGERS wake up with a jolt. A BABY starts to

A mangled body of a dog, a few yards away from the bus.The Bus Conductor spits out his gutkha in anger -
BUS CONDUCTOR
In ko bhenchod mazaa aata hai aise 
marney mein...
A MALE PASSENGER gets down. He gives the dog’s body a bored 
look and then turns around to piss - not too far from it.
Hathi Ram looks at the scene with mild disgust.The Conductor shouts out to the pissing passenger - 
BUS CONDUCTOR (CONT’D)
Chalo chalo, ye ilaaka theek nahi 
hai...
Hathi Ram’s eyes remain on the mangled dog.
EXT. DELHI ROADS - MOVING VEHICLE - NIGHT 7.7 7.7
A hoarding towers over a Delhi road. Sanjeev’s on it, with 
the tagline ‘Voice of India’.
Underneath - A Police bandobast. Approaching vehicles being 
checked.
A Delhi Police vehicle approaches it. The COPS INSIDE signal 
that they’re escorting the car behind.
Behind it - Sanjeev’s car.The COPS ON THE ROAD quickly remove the barrier and let the 
two cars pass. 
Sanjeev looks out. The CONSTABLE lets out a crisp salute at 
him.
Sanjeev nods back as the entourage drives away.6."
"INT. SINGH’S FARMHOUSE - NIGHT 7.8 7.8
A HOUSE STAFF leads Sanjeev towards the lawns - 
Where Vikram Kapoor sits with Singh Saab and his son, 
drinking expensive whiskey.
A slightly drunk Kapoor rises to greet Sanjeev.
VIKRAM KAPOOR
Here he is - the miracle man. But 
for him, I wouldn’t be lucky enough to be sitting here with you tonight, Singh Saab.
He hugs Sanjeev warmly.
Singh remains seated as Sanjeev goes up to him to shake hands 
with him. Singh refuses to, and only stares at Sanjeev in response.
Sanjeev smiles and sits down next to him. Signals for a 
drink.
As Kapoor and Singh Junior chat, Singh Saab turns to Sanjeev -
SINGH SAAB
If you think you’ll be able to get 
away with blackmailing me, you don’t know me well enough.
Sanjeev lets out a little smirk.
SANJEEV
Actually I do know you well enough, Singh Saab. Ye aap ki puraani aadat 
hai... apne employees ko kabhi 
shaabashi nahi dena. Aap ko lagta 
hai isse wo sar pe chadh jaayenge.
Singh looks at him.
SANJEEV (CONT’D)
I know you’re pleased with this deal. Ek maheene pehle tak aap ko 
jo price mil raha thha, ye usse 
kahin zyaada hai. 
(beat)
Ab agar channel ko dubaane ka saara 
credit aapne mujhe diya thha, toh 
revival ka thoda sa credit bhi milna chahiye.7."
"Singh Saab sips his whiskey as a WAITER serves Sanjeev his 
drink.
SINGH SAAB
I never liked you Mehra. Nothing personal... I just don’t like you left-liberal types, hiding your failures with your naive, annoying righteousness. But I must say in these last few weeks, you’ve surprised me a little.
SANJEEV
I guess that’s as close as anyone ever came to getting a compliment from you.
Singh lets out a little smile at that. Sanjeev raises his glass to him, and takes a sip.

Hathi Ram.
BABUA
Sau sau ki shart. Aap press waale 
ho aur rally ke liye aaye ho...

BABUA
(pleased with himself)

RAJBIR GUJJAR

His voice trails off as he sees someone sitting in front of 
the PRINCIPAL. It’s Hathi Ram.
The colour drains off Rajbir’s face.
CHITRAKOOT PRINCIPAL
Rajbir ye Dilli Police se aaye 
hain.
Hathi Ram gets up and offers his hand with a cheeky smile.
HATHI RAM
Haathi Ram Chaudhary. Kuchh routine sawaal thhe, Vishal Tyagi ke puraane case ko le kar.

Hathi Ram takes out his mobile and shows a picture to Rajbir. *
Rajbir looks - It’s the photo of Rajbir with Gwala and *
Bajpayee that Sara had showed to Hathi Ram. *
HATHI RAM (CONT’D)
(bluffs)
Principal saab ko ye sab pata hai? Waise Dilli se agar warrant mangaana pada toh unhe pata chal hee jaayega. Fax machine unhi ke kamre mein rakhi hai na...

Dark. A much younger Rajbir Gujjar, 30, stands guard outside a small town bungalow, along with TWO OTHER CONSTABLES and a DUTY OFFICER.
Headlights approach the bungalow.Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 10."
"Rajbir strains his eyes to see - Two jeeps come to a stop 
near the bungalow.
Rajbir steps forward to check - 
RAJBIR GUJJAR
Kaun hai?
But the Duty Officer pulls him back by his hand.A confused Rajbir watches as the Officer opens the side entry 
gate of the bungalow. 
THREE SILHOUETTES jump out of the jeep, covered in blankets.  *
One of them - wearing canvas shoes.  The three disappear *
inside the house.The Officer follows them inside.Rajbir’s attention goes to the murmurs between the other 
constables.
CONSTABLES
(murmuring)
Donullia aayo hai... Donullia.
An intrigued Rajbir drifts away from them, enters the gates.
His eyes go to - a window. Silhouettes can be seen in the 
light coming from inside. Men talking.
Rajbir walks closer to the window. Tries to peep in.Just then - someone grabs him from behind. Puts a knife on to 
his throat.
It’s the one-eyed Kana Commando, around 30 at this time.
KANA COMMANDO
Kaa dekhat hai morichod?
RAJBIR GUJJAR
(nervous)
Oo... suney Donullia aavo hai.
KANA COMMANDO
Jaa ke kahu ne naa dekho, tu 
dekhego vaa ne? Aur dekh ke kaa karego?
RAJBIR GUJJAR

(MORE)Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 11."
"Mohe bhi saamil hono hai oo ki fauj

Kana Commando studies his face for a long moment.
Then pulls him out of the bungalow.
RAJBIR GUJJAR (CONT’D)
(scared)
Kitt le jaavat hai?
KANA COMMANDO
Donullia se milwaane.
RAJBIR GUJJAR
Par oo toh bheetar haigo.
KANA COMMANDO
Ek bakhat pe ek hajaar aath jagah 
hai Donullia. Bahurupiyo hai vo bahurupiyo.
Kana takes him to the back of a jeep. Thrusts his face in there. 
INSIDE
: Mostly dark in there. Barely visible faces of 
dangerous men.
KANA COMMANDO (CONT’D)
Gujjar hai Masterji. Kahe fauj mein 
saamil hono hai.
Nothing for a few moments. And then - A cold voice emerges out of the darkness and hits Rajbir.
VOICE
Bahot kathin jeevan hai fauj ko. Tu na kar sakego.
RAJBIR GUJJAR
Main... Main kar loongo, Masterji... Hockey mein state khelo hoon. Oo toh police ki naukri mein mann na lagto...
Silence. And then, a SIGH.
VOICE 
Je saale sports quota waale kabahu achche policewaale na bante...
A sneer breaks out in the jeep. Rajbir pleads -RAJBIR GUJJAR (CONT'D)
12."
"RAJBIR GUJJAR
Fauj mein saamil kar lo Masterji. 
Jeevan safal ho jaago...
VOICE
Arey tu naa kar sakego. Tor aankh bataavat hai.
RAJBIR GUJJAR
Main... main kar lungo Masterji.
Silence. And then something SWISHES! And in the next insta nt - *
a knife is right next to Rajbir’s eyeball.
KANA COMMANDO
Toh de tori aankh fir.
The colour drains off Rajbir’s face as the knife stays dangerously close to his eye. Super tense moment. Until - 
Laughter breaks out in the jeep.
VOICE
Ek aur tareeko hai fauj mein saamil 
hone ko. Baahar reh kar fauj ko kaam kar. Fauj ki aankh aur kaan ban.
Rajbir’s face registers the offer.
VOICE (CONT’D)
Bajpayee jee hamre khaas hain. Seva kar bramhan dev ki. Vaa se milne kaun aavat hai, kaun jaavat hai, saari khabar rakh. Dhyaan rakh vaa ko. Samjho? 
RAJBIR GUJJAR
Hau, Masterji.
VOICE 
Kabahu kachhu kaam padey toh mor bhai hai Gwala Gujjar. Vaa se sampark kar.
The jeep starts. 
The knife presses in to Rajbir’s neck, drawing blood.
KANA COMMANDO
Master ki fauj, Karegi mauj, *
Mukhbiri ki sajaa, Sajaa-e-maut.
Terror runs across Rajbir’s face. Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 13."
"Kana Commando pushes him away and runs behind the jeep, and 
jumps in.

RAJBIR GUJJAR
Sach bataaun toh Donullia ko meri ya mere jaison ki koi jarurat nahi.
Hathi Ram looks at him.
RAJBIR GUJJAR (CONT’D)
Jaat waalon ki hamesha madad karta hai Donullia. Isse biradari pe control bana rehta hai... 
(beat)
Chitrakoot mein shaayad hee koi Gujjar parivaar hoga jispe Donullia ya Gwala Bhai ka ehsaan na ho.
HATHI RAM

Tyagi’s Father starts to hit his son in manic anger -
TYAGI’S FATHER
Sahi kahi thhi oo pandat ne... 
Hiranyakashyap hai je morichod, Hiranyakashyap!
Rajbir’s eyes go to – a place in the ground where the sand looks freshly dug.
Rajbir gets down on his knees. Digs frantically.Out comes - the hammer.
RAJBIR GUJJAR
Aadhe ghante mein dhoondh leti 
police ee ke.
Tyagi’s Father has tears in his eyes. He folds his hands in 
front of Rajbir.
TYAGI’S FATHER
Kachhu kar, Rajbir. Mor mora ke 
bacha le.
Rajbir looks at Tyagi’s father as he breaks down in front of him like a child.
RAJBIR GUJJAR (V.O.)
Bundelkhand mein badla lena dharam 
ka kaam maana jaata hai saahab. 
Tyagi ne behnon ka badla le ke apna 
dharam nibhaaya, aur ab uska tau

Next to it on a smaller chair sits a busy Gwala Gujjar, 
signing some papers.
A respectful Rajbir stands in front of him, along with Tyagi.
GWALA GUJJAR
(without looking up)
Je toh kurmi-yan ko maamlo hai. Aur *
tain ne toh pato hai Rajbir, 
Masterji doosri jaat ke kaam mein dakhal na dete.
RAJBIR GUJJAR
Maharaj, Masterji ki fauj mein toh sabhi hain. Katua Kasai bhi hai. Kana Commando bhi hai.
Gwala Gujjar carries on with his paperwork, unimpressed.
Two of his fierce looking men OM JI and FIRANGI stare at 
Rajbir.
Rajbir tries again. Harder, more desperate -Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 16."
"RAJBIR GUJJAR (CONT’D)
Je mooro Masterji ki fauj mein 
bharti hone laayak hai maharaj. Alsation kutto hai je. Jeevan bhar Masterji ki seva karego. Je haath dekho jaa ke. Silli hai patthar ki. Teen teen ke hathodey se maaro hai, hathodey se...
That gets Gwala’s attention - who finally looks at Tyagi.
GWALA GUJJAR
Fauj mein saamil hone ko faislo toh Masterji hee kar sakat hain. Jaa ki pariksha lene ke baad.
He touches the pair of canvas shoes reverentially.
RAJBIR GUJJAR
Par vaa ke layi jaa ko jinda rehno jaroori hai maharaj.

Tyagi sits between the two men of Gwala Gujjar – Om ji and

sach hai ka?
Tyagi - quiet.
FIRANGI
(mocking)
Sach hai dadda, sach hai. Mora ne 
hathode se school mein apne 
saathiyan ke doodh ke daant tod

liye aa jaata. Par usse bhi 
Masterji ki koi khabar nahi milti. 
Tyagi ke dimaag mein bas yehi baat 
chalti rehti ki wo ab tak us aadmi

A restless Tyagi lies on the chaarpaayi in his room, 
scratching something on the wall with one of his finger nails. 
Hard, sharp, incessant.Blood starts to emerge on his finger.The Old Saadhu caretaker appears at the door.
OLD SAADHU
Itto aasaan na hai Donullia se

Tyagi turns to look at him.
OLD SAADHU (CONT’D)
Hogo tor Master. Mor layi toh kakku *

EXT. TIHAR JAIL - BATHING AND WASHING AREA - DAY 7.27 7.27
An open bathing and washing area. Multiple taps under which PRISONERS take turns to bathe and wash their clothes.
It’s Cheeni’s turn at one of the taps. She walks up to it. And looks around. She seems distinctly uncomfortable as she 
starts to take off her clothes. 
After stripping to her underwear, she starts to quickly wash 
herself off.
She feels a presence. And turns to look.The prisoner next to her is staring at her with an intense 
look.
Cheeni doesn’t quite understand. Until her eyes go down - the 
man is trying to jerk off while looking at her.
Cheeni looks away in fear and disgust. And covers herself in 
a towel.
But the man continues with his action, while brazenly staring 
at her.
A LITTLE AWAY
:
Chaaku looks lost in his thoughts as he sits next to an 
overflowing plastic bucket.
His eyes go to – the tattoo on his arm. The ‘C’ with a knife 
wedged through it.
He stares at it for a long time.And then – uncharacteristic - tears well up in his eyes.Just then from behind, a ROUGH PRISONER complains -
ROUGH PRISONER (O.S.)
Jaldi kar na bhonsadi ke...
Chaaku gets conscious. And quickly pours water over his head 
so as to hide his tears.20."
"But the tears just won’t stop. He continues to pour water 
over himself.
We haven’t seen Chaaku this emotional.IN A CORNER
:
Tyagi squats in his underwear, washing his clothes. When he 
hears - 
A dog barking somewhere. A surprised Tyagi turns to look.A STRAY DOG has entered the courtyard and is being chased by 
a couple of baton-wielding JAIL GUARDS.
The other prisoners too notice it. They laugh as - The dog 
dodges the guards.
Someone shouts out in encouragement - 
PRISONER
Haan shaabash Tommy! Haath mat aana 
chutiyon ke!
We see a smile come up on Tyagi’s face for the first time. A big, warm smile.
And just then, the running dog receives a violent kick from 
one of the PRISONERS.
As Tyagi watches the dog yelp in pain - something comes upon 
him.
He marches towards the sneering prisoner.And before the prisoner can realise what’s going on - Tyagi 
grabs him by his neck and headbutts his face. *
Blood erupts as a nose is broken. *
The man SCREAMS. His mates move towards Tyagi threateningly.
Behind, the guards notice this. They whistle and run towards 
the new scene of action.
But Tyagi just stands his ground – Even as the guards come 
and jump upon him to pin him down.
Tyagi doesn’t resist as he lies on the ground, face down. He 
simply turns his head to look at - 
The dog. It’s still managing to run uncaught.Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 21."
"And the smile returns to Tyagi’s face.

Dark, the space lit in moonlight and oil lamps. *
Tyagi sleeps on the cot - 
But his two dogs seem to have been alerted. They’re staring 
at something
 in front.
One of the dog lets out a little bark.
Tyagi slowly opens his eyes. Notices on a wall – eerie *
shadows.He turns around sharply.In front of him - Silhouettes. Men covered in blankets.As a groggy Tyagi tries to make sense of the situation –Kana Commando and another GOON step out of the darkness and 
lift him up. Tyagi catches a brief glimpse of a scared looking Rajbir Gujjar with the men before - 
Kana pushes Tyagi and thrusts his face into the wall.And then from the darkness, another figure emerges and walks 
up to him. We can’t make out his face. Only a slight PROFILE of him in the dim light. 
He brings his mouth next to Tyagi’s ear. And whispers in a 
cold, rasping voice -Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 22."
"DONULLIA GUJJAR
Suney milne ko bado aatur raho

Beat. A realisation comes up on Tyagi’s face.
TYAGI 
Masterji?
The dogs start to wag their tails, like even they realised who the man is.
Donullia’s hand pats the dogs with love. We notice - a lone *
rudraksh tied to his wrist. *
DONULLIA GUJJAR
Masterji ki ek pariksha mein toh tu 
pass ho gavo. Kuttan se sachcho prem karne waale sadaiv mann ke saaf hovat hain. Kaa re Rajbir, sach hai ki nahi?
A nervous Rajbir folds his hands and nods respectfully.
KANA COMMANDO
(rustic English)
If man like dog, he is good man. If dogs like man, he is good man.
Kana Commando moves in closer to Tyagi, his face looking even more dangerous in the dim light.
KANA COMMANDO (CONT’D)
Ab doosri pariksha. Bol, taiyyar 
hai dene ke layi?
TYAGI
Hau!

Toh sun! Doosri pariksha eklavya ki pariksha hai. Door reh kar guru ki bhakti karni padegi.

Jaa ne toh jeher gale mein rakhno 
padego guru ke layi. Tyaag ko, balidaan ko jeher. Jaiso sagar manthan mein Shiv Shambhu ne rakho hato.
A rudraksh dangles around Donullia’s neck. Tyagi catches a glimpse of it.
TYAGI
Kachhu bhi karungo, Masterji. Kachhu bhi.
Kana Commando lets go of Tyagi - who slowly turns around, and comes face to face with Donullia.
We STAY ON Tyagi now as he soaks in the aura of the man in 
front of him.
Tyagi slumps to his knees and folds his hands.
TYAGI (CONT’D)
Aadesh ho, Masterji.
Donullia extends his hand. In his hand - A hammer.
DONULLIA GUJJAR
Toh de vo jo Eklavya ne diyo hato 
apne Guru ke layi.
The shock of the realisation hits Tyagi.Kana Commando forces Rajbir down to the floor. Pins his thumb 
down roughly. Rajbir groans in pain and fear.
KANA COMMANDO
Aur je tain na de sako, toh je 
Gujjar dego.
With shaky hands, Tyagi takes the hammer from Donullia’s hand.
And then he spreads his own left thumb on the floor.His grip tightens on the hammer. His hand slowly goes up.He looks one last time at Donullia with pure devotion. Rajbir watches with pure horror as Tyagi brings down the 
hammer with full force on his own thumb.

have lost them. Until his eyes go to - Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 40."
"THE STEPS - The group is walking down the steps, that lead to 
the river bank.
Hathi Ram follows in the direction.The group reaches the bottom of the steps. Om ji and Firangi 
wait at the last steps as Gwala and the Pujaari step into the waters.
The Pujaari starts to chant some mantras. *
Hathi Ram too reaches up to the bottom. He steps into the 
waters - a little away from the group. *
He glances at Gwala Gujjar from the corner of his eyes. In spite of his devotee like appearance, the man still exudes power.
And just then – Hathi Ram notices – Om ji is looking at him, 
like trying to place him.
Shit. Hathi Ram does a ‘pranaam’ to the river, turns around 
and starts to walk up the stairs - trying to make it look as inconspicuous as possible.
But when he glances back to check, he realises - Om ji is 
still coming after him. And looks like he means business.
That’s it. Hathi Ram runs.And so does Om ji - the gun coming out from behind his back.The crowd. The chaos.Hathi Ram tries to dodge his way past the men and the cows.Om ji - close on his heels.

Late evening. Darkness descending rapidly.
Hathi Ram runs down the road.He can see - Babua waiting outside the parked auto.Hathi Ram discretely signals to him - ‘don’t’. And runs past 
him.
Babua doesn’t quite understand. Until he spots - Om ji coming 
after Hathi Ram.Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 41."
"He quietly gets into his auto and drives away - just as Om ji 
runs past him.
EXT. CHITRAKOOT LANES - DAY 7.48A 7.48A
Om ji comes running and reaches a junction. Several lanes 
lead from it.
He looks around, panting. Hathi Ram is nowhere to be seen.Om ji runs away into a particular lane.
EXT. CHITRAKOOT - ANOTHER LANE - DAY 7.48B 7.48B
Hathi Ram comes out of the hiding. And runs back in the 
direction he came from.
His phone begins to ring. DCP Bhagat calling... *
Hathi Ram answers.
HATHI RAM

Bhagat in his cabin, talking to Hathi Ram on the phone. *
DCP BHAGAT *
Kahaan ho tum?
Hathi Ram doesn’t say anything.
DCP BHAGAT (CONT’D) *
Virk ko Chitrakoot ke SHO ka phone 
aaya thha. Kya chal raha hai Chaudhari?
Hathi Ram still quiet. Bhagat sighs and says in a kind voice -
DCP BHAGAT (CONT’D) *
Virk insubordination ka charge laga raha hai tum pe. Already suspension mein ho, Chaudhari. Abhi koi nayi enquiry lagi toh naukri jaa sakti hai. Main kuchh nahi kar paaunga...
Hathi Ram finally speaks.Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 42."
"HATHI RAM
Sir, aadhi zindagi baap ki aankh 
mein ye dekha ki uska beta chutiya hai. Ab baaki ki zindagi bete ki aankh mein ye nahi dekh sakta ki uska baap chutiya hai.
He cuts the phone. And disappears in the dark lanes of Chitrakoot.
THE END.43."
