"EXT. YAMUNA RIVER BANK - DAY 2.1 2.1
Early morning. Foggy. The waters are calm. And so is the air. 
A MAN sits on the banks, janeu tied to his ear, relieving *
himself. A phone hangs from his neck, playing a soothing *
bhajan. *
He tries hard. Applies pressure. Nothing. Some more. Nothing. He closes his eyes, takes a deep breath and for one last 
time, goes for it with all he’s got...
And just then - SPLASH! A SCUBA DIVER pops out of the calm 
water, GASPING, shattering the silence and STARTLING the man.
POTTY MAN
O bhenchod!
The Diver looks at someone and gestures ‘nothing’.
We follow the Diver’s gaze and see - Ansari sitting on the 
bank, reading his IAS study material. *
A disappointed Ansari points in a direction -
ANSARI
Us taraf try karo.
The Diver dives back in with a SPLASH.
TITLE APPEARS - ‘LOST AND FOUND’ *
FADE IN:
INT. JAMUNA PAAR POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY 2.2 2.2
SPLASH - a mug-full of water hits Tyagi’s face. Constable Tokas grabs him by his hair and pulls his head up.
TOKAS
Ab bata. Bolega?
Tyagi looks at him. His eyes - calm and silent. Like a Zen 
monk.
TOKAS (CONT’D)
Aankh neeche!
Tyagi continues to look at him.
Constable Bhati swings his lathi several times.WHACK! WHACK! WHACK! It lands on Tyagi’s legs with a vicious 
sound."
"TOKAS (CONT’D)
Neeche kar aankh, maadarchod!
But - Tyagi’s eyes still stay where they are - looking right 
back into Tokas’. A gaze cold as death.
And by just that bit - Tokas’ confidence wavers. He turns to 
throw a quick look back towards -
OUTSIDE THE INTERROGATION ROOM:
Outside which - Hathi Ram and Ansari stand watching the show.Hathi Ram turns to look at Ansari.
HATHI RAM
Paintaalees murder? Paintaalees???
Ansari nods. 
HATHI RAM (CONT’D)
Lund nahi bataana isne!
INT. HOTEL UPTOWN - ROOM #2 - DAY 2.3 2.3
CLOSE ON a dead cockroach. Ants having a go at it.Hathi Ram and Ansari walk into the room where Cheeni and 
Kabir had stayed. They look around, searching for nothing in particular, while the Waiter and Manager tail them nervously.
WAITER
Teen din ruke the. Aane jaane ka 
koi time nahin tha. Mujhe toh lag 
hee raha thha koi gadbad -
HATHI RAM
Aur kuch?
WAITER
Ek towel bhi churaya. 
(glances at the Manager)
Keh rahe hain tankhwah mein se 
katega ab...
The Manager gives him a dirty look as Hathi Ram walks out of the room saying -
HATHI RAM
Aur kuch dekha suna?
The Waiter thinks.2."
"INT. HOTEL UPTOWN - CORRIDOR + ROOM #1 - DAY 2.4 2.4
Hathi Ram walks towards the adjacent room. The Manager tries 
to stop him.
MANAGER
Sir guest hain andar...
Hathi Ram gives him a look. KNOCKS. After a while, a half-naked ANNOYED MAN half-opens the door.
MAN IN HOTEL ROOM
Kaun hai be - 
But the colour drains from his face when he spots the cops.
HATHI RAM
Room check karna hai.
MAN IN HOTEL ROOM
Par sir...
Hathi Ram pushes his way in. A filmy song plays on the TV.
On the bed is a WOMAN, quite clearly a cheap hooker.Hathi Ram goes around looking, the man following him around-
MAN IN HOTEL ROOM (CONT’D)
Sir... coujin hai Sir. Wo iski 
shaadi ki shopping ke liye Dilli 
aaye thhe. Reservation nahin tha 
isliye room share karna pada - 
Hathi Ram peeps under the bed. Nothing. He turns to the 
Waiter -
HATHI RAM
Kuch yaad aaya?
The Waiter recalls something.
WAITER
Haan saab... Nikalne se pehle ek ko 
phone pe baat karte hue suna. Bahut 
gusse mein lag raha tha. 
HATHI RAM
Kya keh raha tha?
WAITER
Kisi se jhagda chal raha tha. Bol 
raha tha ‘teen din se yehi sun raha 
hoon, tum Masterji se baat karwao’.
HATHI RAM
(expectant)
Aur kuchh suna? 
(MORE)3."
"Kis ke baare mein baat kar rahe 
thhe? Koi aur naam waam...
WAITER
Nahin sahab. Bas itna hee.
Hathi Ram frowns. Then remembers the ‘cousins’.
HATHI RAM
Inke ID lo. Dekhein kaun se cousin 
hain...
MAN IN HOTEL ROOM 
Sir... sir wo surname alag hai 
sir... wo bua ki side se hai na...
The man blabbers on as Hathi Ram and Ansari walk out.
WAITER
Ek aur baat Sir. Wo jo killer jaisi 
shakal waala thha, dabaadab 
cigarette phoonkta thha. Din mein 
teen packet mangwata thha...
Hathi Ram looks at him with interest.
HATHI RAM
Brand kaun sa thha...?
INT. JAMUNA PAAR POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY 2.5 2.5
CLOSE ON a ciggie as it gets lit. It’s Ansari smoking. A bit uneasily.
Sitting in front of Ansari and Hathi Ram - Chaaku.
HATHI RAM
Hotel ke waiter ka bayaan aa gaya. 
Ki tum log Sanjeev Mehra ko maarne 
ka plan kar rahe thhe.
CHAAKU
Kaun Sanjeev Mehra?
Hathi Ram sighs. The smoke from Ansari’s cigarette drifts towards Chaaku. He 
smacks his lips.
HATHI RAM
Tyagi ko kab se jaanta hai?
CHAAKU
Kaun Tyagi, saab?
Ansari LUNGES at Chaaku.HATHI RAM (CONT'D)4."
"But - Hathi Ram puts a hand on his shoulder. Signals him to 
take it easy.
Ansari sits down. Takes an uneasy puff. Blows out a fresh 
round of smoke in Chaaku’s direction.
Chaaku - tempted. Ansari - uneasy. He clears his throat.
HATHI RAM
Baaki dono ki lambi history sheet 
nikali hai. Tera record clean hai.
Hathi Ram casually pushes the cigarette pack in Chaaku’s 
direction.
Chaaku’s tempted. But he waits. Behind - Ansari clears his 
throat again.
HATHI RAM (CONT’D)
Sarkari gawaah ban ja, saste mein 
chhootega... DCP saab se main khud *
baat karunga.
He looks at Chaaku. Chaaku looks at the ciggies.
Hathi Ram nods at him - a kind, friendly nod.That’s it. Chaaku grabs at the packet. Plucks one out. Hathi 
Ram leans forward and lights it.
Chaaku takes a long drag, looking at Ansari. Ansari too does 
the same - but has to clear his itchy throat.
HATHI RAM (CONT’D)
Kab se kaam kar raha hai Tyagi ke saath?
Chaaku’s still in nicotine heaven. Hathi Ram waits. Finally -
HATHI RAM (CONT’D)
Dekh. Wo Tyagi toh shaatir hai. Paintaalees murder kar ke bhi nahi pakda gaya. Kal sab tujh pe daal dega. Tab kya karega?
Behind - Ansari coughs. That throat’s really bothering him.
HATHI RAM (CONT’D)
Plan kya thha? Tera kya role tha?
Chaaku seems to be considering. The moment builds.
And just then - Ansari breaks out into a fit of coughing.That’s it - Chaaku bursts out laughing as he turns to Ansari.Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 5."
"CHAAKU
Sorry... sorry saab... Personal mat 
lena... Par aap cigarette chutiyon ke jaise peete ho!
Ansari sits there - red-faced, trying to stop coughing.
Hathi Ram’s face gives away his frustration. His eyes go to - A tattoo
 on Chaaku’s arm. A crescent moon shaped ‘C’ and a 
knife wedging through it. Hathi Ram points at it - 
HATHI RAM
Chal itna toh bata de - C for...?
Chaaku fixes him with a gaze as he takes a drag -
CHAAKU
C for Chaaku!
Hathi Ram slaps him.
HATHI RAM
C for chutiya!
INT. JAMUNA PAAR POLICE STATION - DAY 2.6 2.6
Hathi Ram and Ansari walk out of the interrogation room. 
Ansari has embarrassment written all over his face. 
HATHI RAM
Gaandu... tune toh bola thha cigarette pee hai tune...?
ANSARI
Sorry Sir... kayi saal ho gaye...
An awkward beat. And then - Hathi Ram cracks up.
HATHI RAM
Pakad liya haraami ne!
Ansari’s red-faced, but laughs along. Until they notice -
SHO Virk looking in their direction from outside his cabin.Hathi Ram calls out to the constables authoritatively - 
HATHI RAM (CONT’D)
Tokas... Wo Kabir ko le ke jaao 
andar. Aur uske saamne is Tope Singh ki marammat karo, jaao. Aur suno, chodna kam chillana zyaada.
Virk turns away. And Hathi Ram cracks up again.6."
"HATHI RAM (CONT’D)
(laughing)
Is Tope Singh ke license pe jo 
address hai, wahaan koi gaya?
ANSARI
Maheenon se bandh pada hai sir. 
Makaan ki registry kis naam mein 
hai check karwa rahe hain. Kal tak 
aa jaayegi detail.
Hathi Ram nods.
EXT. JAMUNA PAAR POLICE STATION - TEA SHOP - DAY 2.7 2.7
The tea shop opposite to the police station. A 25-YEAR OLD 
DARK MAN sits there, keeping an eye on the police station. We’ll meet him again later, but for now let’s just say he looks DARK AND DANGEROUS.
INT. JAMUNA PAAR POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY 2.8 2.8
A scared Cheeni is interrogated by Manju Verma.
Ansari stands behind her. Protocol. 
MANJU VERMA
Bol. Kisne bheja tujhe? Hain? Kya 
plan tha? 
CHEENI
Main... Main kuch nahin jaanti 
sahab - 
Manju Verma raises her hand to slap her.
MANJU VERMA
Sahab hoon main? Sahab hoon kya? Aurat mard ka farak samjhaaon?
CHEENI
Sorry, sorry Madam. Main kuch nahin jaanti...
MANJU VERMA
Itni subah un teenon ke saath kya kar rahi thi?
CHEENI
Raat ko dost ke ghar gayi thi. Subah room pe jaana tha. Auto nahin mil raha -
ANSARI
Toh subah lift li inse?7."
"CHEENI
Haan saab.
ANSARI
Toh us hotel ka towel kahaan se 
aaya teri bag mein?
Cheeni is stumped.
CHEENI
Wo... wo saab... inhone daal diya 
hoga saab... main toh dost ke ghar 
se aa rahi -
MANJU VARMA
Chal naam bata dost ka...
Cheeni goes quiet. Manju SLAPS her.
MANJU VERMA
Dost ya customer? Jhooth bolti hai saali Nepali randi! 
Cheeni looks at her - aghast.
MANJU VERMA (CONT’D)
Dhandha karey hai na tu? Kisko deti 
hai? Foreigneron ko? Haan? Dollar 
dete hain tujhe badle mein?
Cheeni doesn’t know what to say.
ANSARI
Dollar kahaan se aaye tere paas?
CHEENI
Sir - wo dollar toh... wo hobby hai meri currency ikattha karne ki...
Manju Verma SLAPS her.
MANJU VERMA
Chutiya bana rahi hai? Haan? Ye koi 
hobby hoti hai?
(slaps again)
Singing... dancing... ye hobby hoti hai.
Ansari intervenes.
ANSARI
Kaam kahaan karti thhi?
INT. SHOPPERS ZONE MALL - DAY 2.9 2.9
A STORE MANAGER looks at Cheeni’s picture.8."
"MANAGER
Ho sakta hai saab. Shaayad thhi 
yehaan par kuchh din...
ANSARI
Ho sakta hai matlab? Haan ya naa?
MANAGER
Matlab... Sab ek jaisi lagti hai saab...
He laughingly points towards the other girls in the store. North eastern girls with sad faces and forced smiles.
MANAGER (CONT’D)
Aur inke naam bhi ekdum Chinese waale. Yaad hee nahi rehte...
He laughs again, but Ansari’s sharp glare shuts him up.
ANSARI
Record toh rakhte hogey? Mary Lyngdoh ka naam check karo.
MANAGER
(nervous)
Temp staff hai saab... Hafte hafte mein job badalte hain yeh log. Ab kahaan record...
Ansari stares at him in anger.
INT. HATHI RAM’S HOUSE - DAY 2.10 2.10*
Morning. The disco light in the little temple blings as Hathi 
Ram gets dressed for work, muttering Hanuman Chalisa.
Sid walks out of his room. Ready for school.
Momentarily suspending his prayers midway -
HATHI RAM
Chal, school chhod deta hoon tujhe.
But Sid just walks away - out of the door. Banging the door 
shut behind him.
Hathi Ram just stares for a few moments. And then - Anger 
rises on his face. He storms towards the door, shouting -
HATHI RAM (CONT’D)
Sid! Ruk!
And just as he’s about to open the door, Renu stops him.
RENU
Kyun lad rahe ho subah subah?Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 9."
"HATHI RAM
Main lad raha hoon? Seedhe moonh 
baat nahin kar sakta? Maine kaha 
school chhod deta hoon toh -
RENU
Yehi toh problem hai. Tumne poochha  
usse ki kya tum use school chhod sakte ho? Seedha order diya hoga.
HATHI RAM
Ab main pemission maangoon us se? Baap main hoon ki wo?
Renu shakes her head.
RENU
Ditto Daddyji ki copy ho tum, Hathi *
Ram Chaudhary. Jhaadte raho thaanedaari bete ke saath... 
Ouch! That really seems to have hurt Hathi Ram.
HATHI RAM
Daddyji ki copy? Wo belt se maarte thhe mujhe. Aaga peechha na dekha unhone kabhi kootayi ke pehle.
(beat)
Maine kabhi haath uthaaya tere bete pe?
Renu just walks away to the kitchen. Hathi Ram’s eyes go to - 
An old B/W picture on the wall. A stern looking man. Daddyji. 
It’s quite clear Hathi Ram doesn’t remember him very fondly. *
Hathi Ram stares at the picture for a long time. Then quietly grabs his keys and his cap and walks out of the door. *
EXT. HATHI RAM'S HOUSE - DAY 2.10A 2.10A *
NOTE: New scene number added. To be added in the schedule.
*
Hathi Ram walks down the stairs. As he reaches the bottom, he *
notices the PRESS WALA outside curiously peeping at *
something. *
It’s his brother-in-law JITU arguing with the GOODS CARRIER *
AUTOWALA over luggage. *
JITU *
Rakhwa de yaar upar saamaan, aisi *
kya baat ho gayi... *
(notices Hathi Ram) *
Jee-jaa-jiiiiii!!!Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 10."
"He gives Hathi Ram a tight hug, who doesn’t seem that chuffed *
to see him. *
JITU (CONT’D)
Kahaan chal diye subah subah 
uniform pehen ke?
HATHI RAM
Picture ki shooting hai. Policewale ka role kar raha hoon.
Jitu laughs, not getting the sarcasm. From behind, Renu’s *
voice approaches. She has Hathi Ram’s tiffin in her hands. *
RENU
Arey apna tiffin toh le ke - *
(notices Jitu) *
Jitu Bhaiyya! What a surprise  *
brother! *
JITU
Arre apna toh kaam hi surprise wala hai sister!
HATHI RAM
Yaar Jitu. Main thoda jaldi mein hoon. Sorry - 
RENU
Ruk jaao thodi der. Itne din ke baad aaye hain, breakfast kar lo *
saath...
JITU
Koi nahi! Kal kar lenge breakfast. *
Main hoon ek-do din.
That depresses Hathi Ram further. He turns to Renu - 
HATHI RAM
Yeh hai... Ek-do din
.
Renu makes a face - ‘Don’t be rude!’
JITU
Jaate jaate samaan toh andar rakhwa do jijaji!
He points at - A really huge carton. Hathi Ram sighs!
INT. JAMUNA PAAR POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY 2.11 2.11
Hathi Ram walks towards the interrogation room, still annoyed 
- While Ansari struggles to keep pace with him.
HATHI RAM
Main phodta hoon. Tu dawai de.Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 11."
"Hathi Ram barges in, loud enough to STARTLE Kabir - who’s 
squatting in a corner.
Hathi Ram removes his watch and hands it to a constable.
HATHI RAM (CONT’D)
Kapde utaaro iske. *
KABIR
(pleading)
Saab mujhe kuch nahin pata saab...
Hathi Ram slaps him hard - stunning Kabir. *
HATHI RAM *
Chhupa raha hai tu musalmaan hai? *
Tokas and Bhati pin Kabir to a chair and try to strip him. He 
resists.
HATHI RAM (CONT’D)
Kabir M. Yeh M kya hai?
KABIR
Bas... M hee hai saab! Sach.
Tokas and Bhati are still struggling with the pants.
Hathi Ram shoves that circumcision certificate into his face.
HATHI RAM
Aur ye certificate?
KABIR
Saab, wo infection hua thha, 
bachpan mein... operation ke baad papa ne banwa diya tha saab...
HATHI RAM
Operation ke baad ya khatna ke baad?
Kabir - quiet.
HATHI RAM (CONT’D)
Aur gaadiyan churana kisne sikhaya? Papa ne? Ya Abbu ne?
Kabir looks at him. *
KABIR
Saab... wo... main...
HATHI RAM
Kya plan hai? Kyun naatak kar raha hai Hindu hone ka?Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 12."
"KABIR
Nahi saab...
HATHI RAM
Tope Singh ne sab bataya hamein. 
Sanjeev Mehra ko maarne ki planning teri aur Tyagi ki thi.
KABIR
Saab nahin saab - 
HATHI RAM
History sheet mein tum donon ka hee naam aaya hai katue...
Ansari tries pretending he didn’t hear that, but he flinches. 
Hathi Ram too realizes. It’s kind of awkward.Ansari can feel - Tokas and Bhati glancing at him. Before 
they go back to their task and manage to pull off Kabir’s pants.
HATHI RAM (CONT’D)
Chaddi utaro iski.
KABIR
Nahin saab... Saab nahin saab...
Kabir holds on to his underwear. His pleading eyes go to Ansari - Who tries to keep a stoic face.
Tokas holds back Kabir’s hands. Bhati pulls down his undies.And just then... PITTER PATTER... SOUND of a stream of liquid 
hitting the floor.
Kabir has peed. The cops are disgusted.
HATHI RAM
Maa ki chut iski!
And he pushes Kabir away. The naked Kabir falls off the chair. Crying with shame, in a 
pool of his own piss. It’s pathetic.
ANSARI
Sir... Main baat karoon?
Tokas and Bhati share a look.
Hathi Ram signals to the constables and they all step out.Ansari takes a cloth and goes to Kabir, who first cowers in 
fear and then realizes that Ansari is trying to clean him.13."
"He looks at Ansari - who gives him his pants. Kabir takes 
them cautiously. Wears them.
Ansari takes something out from his wallet. Gives it to 
Kabir.
ANSARI (CONT’D)
Mere abbu ne di thhi. Padho. Kaam ki cheez hai.
Kabir, still sobbing, looks at it tentatively.
It’s an Urdu phrase on a card.
KABIR
Urdu nahin aati saab.
Ansari - a bit surprised.
ANSARI
Kyun? Bachpan mein padhwaayi nahi *
Abbu ne? *
Kabir shakes his head.
ANSARI (CONT’D)
Shuab ul imaan se hai. ‘Wo shaqs 
jahannum mein shaamil nahi hoga, jo Allah ke khauf se roya ho.’
Ansari looks Kabir in the eyes.
ANSARI (CONT’D)
Dekh. Galti toh ho gayi. Par ab sab sach sach bataa de. Varna ye Inspector jahannum dikha dega tujhe.
Kabir fights back his tears.
KABIR
Wo maar denge saab...
ANSARI
Kuchh nahi hoga. Main hoon na. Sab bataayega toh tujhe sarkaari gawaah banaane ke liye baat karoonga upar.
He fixes Kabir with a kind gaze.
INT. JAMUNA PAAR POLICE STATION - DAY 2.12 2.12
Ansari walks out to see Hathi Ram waiting for him there with 
two cups of tea. Hathi Ram hands him a cup.
ANSARI
Set ho gaya Sir. Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 14."
"HATHI RAM
(awkward)
Good. Er, wo... andar thoda zyaada 
nikal gaya munh se...
Ansari smiles - equally awkward.
ANSARI
It worked, Sir.
INT. JAMUNA PAAR POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY 2.13 2.13
Kabir sits opposite to Hathi Ram and Ansari. A cup of tea *
lies untouched in front of him. *
KABIR
Main Tyagi ko nahi jaanta saab. In 
teenon ko hee pehle kabhi nahi 
mila. Maa kasam.
HATHI RAM
Toh fir kaam kisne diya? 
KABIR
Baakiyon ka nahin pata, mujhe kaam 
Taariq ne diya tha. 
HATHI RAM
Kaun Taariq? 
KABIR
Mechanic hai. Pehle bhi gaadiyan 
churayi hai maine uske liye. Hamesha ki tarah advance diya. Pachaas hazaar. Baaki kaam ke baad.
CLOSE of Hathi Ram’s Diary. He writes – Taarik. Then corrects it to Taariq.
WE SEE THE FOLLOWING IMAGES AS KABIR SPEAKS:
EXT. MUZAFFARNAGAR BUS STAND - NIGHT 2.14 2.14
Kabir gets down from a rickety DELHI-MUZAFFARNAGAR bus.
HATHI RAM (V.O.)
Kaam kya bataya?
EXT. DELHI STREET - NIGHT 2.15 2.15
Kabir innocuously hangs around a couple of cars.
Looks around. No one.Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 15."
"KABIR (V.O.)
Baahar ki gaadi churakar in ko 
Dilli mein milna tha. Munirka ke hotel mein. Fir inke saath rehna thha... jahaan ye bolein le ke jaana tha. Aur kaam khatam hone ke baad gaadi thikaane lagaani thi...
He calmly walks to a car. Pulls out a steel ruler, slides it into the window slit, yanks it around a couple of times.
Finally - CLICK - it unlocks.
EXT. DELHI MOTOR MARKET - DAY 2.16 2.16
Ansari walks down a lane crammed with small auto workshops. 
He talks to a SHOPKEEPER, who points further down the lane.
Ansari keeps walking.
HATHI RAM (V.O.)
Kahaan milega?
KABIR (V.O.)
Narela mein garage hai... Motor 
market mein.
Finally he reaches a garage - MERSIDIS GARAGE. It’s shut.
He asks a MECHANIC in the neighboring shop - 
ANSARI
Taariq kahaan hai?
MECHANIC
Do din se nahin aaya sahab.
ANSARI
Kahaan rehta hai?
The mechanic shrugs.Ansari is sort of pissed. The heat. The dust. And a dead end.
INT. JAMUNA PAAR POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY 2.17 2.17
Kabir sips his tea like a deer at a watering hole - his 
nervous eyes on Hathi Ram and Ansari.
KABIR
Chaar din pehle main in teenon se hotel mein mila.
ANSARI
Teenon se? Matlab wo ladki bhi thhi?16."
"Kabir nods.
HATHI RAM
Fir kya kiya itne din?
Kabir hesitates. 
ANSARI
Dekh... saab ko sab sach sach bata 
de. Nahi toh phans jaayega.
KABIR
Saab, mujhe pata nahi thha saab. Mujhe laga bas gaadi mein teen chaar din ghoomaana hai inko...
ANSARI
Kahaan?
KABIR
Wo... Sanjeev Mehra ke peechhe.
INSERT

Chaaku clicks photos on his cell.
KABIR (V.O.)
Wo Chaaku - woh photo le raha tha. 
Ghar ki... Office ki... fir mujhe 
Tyagi ke paas gun dikhi... main dar 
gaya saab...
INT. JAMUNA PAAR POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY 2.18 2.18
Back to the grind.
KABIR
Main gaadi churaata hoon saab... 
par ye sab nahi karta... maa kasam. Maine Taariq ko phone lagaaya, bola mujhe nahi karna. Taariq ne dhamki di saab, ki wo maar dega mujhe...
Hathi Ram closes in.Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 17."
"HATHI RAM
In ke paas gun thi. Mauka tha. Toh 
maara kyun nahin?
KABIR
Pata nahi saab... Par wo Tyagi 
phone pe kisi se lad raha tha. Baat 
karna chahta tha kisi se... 
Hathi Ram and Ansari glance at each other.
HATHI RAM
‘Masterji’ se?
Kabir looks at him with surprise.
KABIR
Haan. Bol raha thha jab tak Masterji se baat nahi hogi, kaam nahi karunga. Fir ek din subah achaanak se bola Dilli se chalo.
It’s Hathi Ram’s turn to be surprised.
HATHI RAM
Arrest hue toh Dilli chhod ke jaa rahe thhe?
Kabir nods.
OUTSIDE THE INTERROGATION ROOM
:
Hathi Ram and Ansari walk out.
HATHI RAM (CONT’D)
Wo phone milna chahiye Ansari. Is 
‘Masterji’ ka number mil sakta hai usme. Plus wo photos, Sanjeev Mehra ke... case banaane ke liye solid evidence hoga.
ANSARI
Haan, Sir. Aur doosra wo Taariq. 
Yehi do leads hain abhi.
HATHI RAM
(nods; thinking)
Chitrakoot jaana padega. Is Tyagi 
ki kundali kholne.
INT. POLICE HQ - DCP BHAGAT’S OFFICE - DAY 2.19 2.19*
DCP Bhagat looks at Hathi Ram. *
DCP BHAGAT *
Yaar, yehaan itna kuchh chal raha hai... wo sab chhod ke Chitrakoot?Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 18."
"They are in Bhagat’s cabin. Bhagat seems in a hurry, as he 
checks on a few papers, while Dahiya waits for him.
HATHI RAM
Sir urgent nahi hota toh... Dekhiye Tyagi shooter hai, Chitrakoot se. Kabir driver, Meerut se. Baaki dono Dilli se hain. Wo Tope Singh shaayad back up shooter ya helper thha, aur wo ladki cover hogi, taaki in pe shaq na ho. Par sawaal ye hai ki in sab ko kaam pe kisne lagaaya? Poora plan kiska thha?
DCP BHAGAT *
Wo Tyagi hee hoga. History sheeter hai. Darjanon murder kar chuka hai.
HATHI RAM
Sir, agar Tyagi hota toh in chaaron ka us se koi connection hota. Ye toh usey jaante tak nahi.
DCP Bhagat looks unconvinced as he picks up his files and *
signals to Dahiya - ‘let’s go’.
EXT. POLICE HQ - CORRIDORS - DAY 2.20 2.20*
Bhagat and Dahiya hurry down the corridor. Hathi Ram tries to 
keep pace.
OFFICER DAHIYA
Ho sakta hai ek doosre ko na jaanne ka naatak kar rahe hon...
Hathi Ram ignores him, addresses Bhagat -
HATHI RAM
Par Sir... wo ‘Masterji’... jisse baat na ho paane par Tyagi ne plan tak cancel kar diya... wo toh hotel ke waiter ne bhi confirm kiya hai. Ho na ho iss ‘Masterji’ ka koi connection hai case se. Aur wo shaayad Chitrakoot mein hee milega...
Bhagat shakes his head.
DCP BHAGAT *
Par wahaan chale jaaoge toh... Inki remand khatam hone ke pehle case banaana hai yehaan... 
There’s an edge of desperation to Hathi Ram’s voice now.Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 19."
"HATHI RAM
Sir usi ke liye... investigation 
aage badhaane ka yehi tareeka hai. In chaaron ki history jaanni hogi. Kaun hain, kiske liye kaam karte hain... In ki kahaani mein peechhe tak jaayein toh shaayad poora link samajh aayega.
They reach the elevator. *
Bhagat presses the button and turns to look at Hathi Ram - *
who pleads with his eyes.
DCP BHAGAT *
(sighs)
Achcha theek hai. But keep it short.
Hathi Ram can barely conceal his excitement.
DCP BHAGAT (CONT’D) *
Aur dhyaan rahe, Tyagi ka naam abhi baahar na aaye. Maamla thoda thanda ho jaane do, fir press release de denge.
Hathi Ram nods as Bhagat enters the elevator . *
EXT. DELHI - SINGH’S FARMHOUSE - DAY 2.21 2.21
One of those Delhi farmhouses reeking of old money. A table *
laid out in the sun where FAMILY and FRIENDS sit eating. *
A little away - Sanjeev and Jai sit in front of the frail and *
old but still- imposing figure of SINGH SAAB, and his America-returned son SINGH JUNIOR. *
SINGH SAAB
It must be the bloody Opposition behind this. Election aane waale hain. Government ka naam kharaab hoga ki dekho bhai inke raaj mein media pe attack ho raha hai. Finally we have a government and a PM who is doing something for the country, but these bhenchods will not let that happen.
(beat; with over-concern)
Anyways, tell me, how are you dealing with it beta?
He cuts his cigar and lights it up. *
SANJEEV
(mumbles)
I’m all right, sir. Thank you.Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 20."
"Singh Junior steps in, with an edge to his tone.
SINGH JUNIOR
The lawyers said you used bad words 
against Dad.
Singh Saab turns to glare at him.
SINGH SAAB
Who asked you to be here? Go, go see if the turkey has been served. *
Go!
Singh Junior fumes for a while, then huffs away from there.
SINGH SAAB (CONT’D)
Idiot! And I thought Wharton would fix him.
He mutters some more like a frustrated father, and then turns to Sanjeev, equally frustrated -
SINGH SAAB (CONT’D)
Bete why are you doing this? Arey bhai ab agar aapke under channel perform nahi kar raha hai toh what can I do? Aap mere bete jaise ho, par bete toh nahi ho na ki aap ka bhi bojh dhoun?
Sanjeev keeps quiet.
SINGH SAAB (CONT’D)
And what is this monkey business I hear you are up to? The expressway is a gift to the people of the country. Aap usme bhi nuks dhoondh 
rahe ho?
SANJEEV
Sir I was only doing my job as a journalist.
SINGH SAAB
Then go do it somewhere else. Hamein baksh do yaar. Just announce 
that you are going on an indefinite leave due to all the stress in your life, and the rest these boys will manage.
(referring Jai)
Sanjeev looks at Jai, and then at the old man -
SANJEEV
If you fire me at this point, my career is over. 
(MORE)Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 21."
"There’s a non-competitive clause 
that says I can’t join a rival channel for one year. I’ll be forgotten in a year.
SINGH SAAB
Arey toh kuchh aur kar lo. You are 
still young. Go write a book on the state of affairs in this country. Or try organic farming. It’s very therapeutic, trust me.
He looks square at Sanjeev and his tone acquires a cold edge.
SINGH SAAB (CONT’D)
But please don’t be a trouble maker. It’s not good. For me, for you, for anybody.
He stares at him some more, then turns his attention to the GARDENER - 
SINGH SAAB (CONT’D)
Rambir, ye ghaas kyun nahi kaati ab tak... sab saale muftkhor paale hue hain maine...
No mistaking who that’s aimed at. Sanjeev sits there, staring at the ground with indignation for a long time - the anger rising in him.
And then he gets up.
SINGH SAAB (CONT’D)
Bete khaana waana khaa ke jaana.
SANJEEV
I’d have loved to sir, but have to 
be somewhere... 
(looks into Singh’s eyes)
To identify the men who tried to kill me... but couldn’t.
And then Sanjeev turns around and walks away - Singh’s eyes following him like a hawk.

Virk’s cabin. He is not there. As Sanjeev takes his seat -
MANJU VERMA
Sir ek selfie le loon? Family ko *
dikhaane ke liye...
Before Sanjeev can reply, she moves in close to him and 
CLICKS a picture. And then quickly hides the phone as she sees Hathi Ram walk in.
Sanjeev’s eyes go to - the four accused being led by Hathi 
Ram and Ansari. He just can’t take his eyes off them as they are made to line up in front of him.
His eyes move - from Kabir to Cheeni to Chaaku to Tyagi - who 
stares straight at Sanjeev with cold, expressionless eyes . *
HATHI RAM
In mein se kisi ko aapne pehle kabhi dekha hai sir?
No response from Sanjeev. He’s just staring at Tyagi with fascination. Something about those eyes!
Hathi Ram touches him gently on the elbow. And Sanjeev comes 
to.
SANJEEV
Huh? Nahi. Kabhi nahi.
HATHI RAM
Pakka?
Sanjeev nods.

Sanjeev searches for an answer on Hathi Ram’s face. But - Hathi Ram changes the subject.

Sanjeev looks at him gravely. And nods.
Just then - his car drives up to them.Hathi Ram notices a sticker on the back of the car -

beams with pride-

HATHI RAM

Hathi Ram tries again - 
HATHI RAM (CONT’D)

Sid shrugs like he doesn’t care.
They walk in awkward silence to reach the police car - the 
odd one in the parking lot.
They get in. Hathi Ram turns the ignition key.It cranks but doesn’t start.Again. Same result.Sid looks at Hathi Ram - who seems a bit concerned now.He tries it again. And again. But no, the damn thing just 
won’t start.
HATHI RAM (CONT’D)

Sid rolls his eyes as Hathi Ram grunts and jumps out. 
He opens the bonnet. Tries fiddling with the wires, cursing.Sid watches - as the fancy cars roll out from the parking one 
by one.
He spots Saloni. She jumps into one of the cars. It’s that 
cocky boy Arjun driving it while his driver sits behind.
Damn - Sid’s super embarrassed. As they drive past - Sid 
tries to hide his face.

sitting next to him is looking at him in the rear view.
Sanjeev’s phone rings - but doesn’t show a number. He picks

Ansari checks with a shopkeeper. Continues his walk.Finally, he reaches -

A hive of pigeon-coop houses. He walks up the rickety 
staircase to the third floor - which has a small terrace.
An ANGRY MUSLIM OLD MAN, holds a rubber cricket ball and a 
knife in his hands. While a MUSLIM BOY pleads -
MUSLIM BOY
Chacha, fir ball idhar nahin aayegi chacha. Please chacha!
But the Old Man is in no mood to forgive. He cuts the ball and throws the halves at the crushed Boy.
The Old Man notices - the cops.

From below, the Boy throws the ball at the Old Man, but *
misses. The Old Man takes his chappal off and throws it back *
at the boy, shouting - *

A wild chase on the busy footpaths of Delhi. Past small 
shops, parked auto rickshaws, zooming cars and crowd. 
Taariq is quite out of breath now, yet he runs.So does Ansari. But Taariq seems to be getting away.Ansari stands right in the middle of the road and barricades 
an oncoming bike. The bike screeches to a halt. 
He almost pushes the BIKER down from his bike, gestures Bhati 
to sit pillion, muttering to the Biker - 
ANSARI
Emergency hai.
And even before the Biker can realise, Ansari and Bhati have zoomed away after Taariq.
Traffic and pedestrians ahead. Ansari doesn’t drop pace, 
dangerously dodging past obstacles.
Bhati seems concerned with the video game like driving -
BHATI
Thoda dekh ke saab...
But Ansari won’t let go. He’s getting close to Taariq.Taariq looks back, terrified, and runs faster.Ansari too accelerates. Bhati SCREAMS. For just then -A COLLEGE GIRL listening to music on her headphones, crosses

‘Nam myoho renge kyo’. ‘Nam myoho renge kyo’. Over and over 
again. And one of Dolly’s friends gently hits a gong with a little stick every now and then.
Sitting somewhere there - Dolly. A picture of sincerity and *

Sara looks at his brooding face.
SANJEEV (CONT’D)
You know... you can meet a million killers as a journalist. But it’s another thing to come face to face with your
 killer. There’s something 
raw, something primal about that experience... it’s almost spiritual. Those eyes... they’re haunting me.
He turns to Sara and looks into her eyes, looking rather vulnerable.

Does that make me a weak person?
SARA
No. That only makes you real.Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 35."

judge me.
They stare into each other’s eyes.
And then he leans in for a kiss.And soon, they’re both having a go at each other like they’ve 
been meaning to for a while, hungrily tearing at each others’ clothes.
Sara takes Sanjeev by hand and pulls him towards the bedroom 
door.
As she opens it - a little Beagle turns its head to look at 
them and starts barking for attention.

LAUGHTER coming from inside. Hathi Ram sighs - he’s so not in the mood for this!
He walks in to see the expected - Jitu and Renu happily 
chatting away.
And the unexpected - A weird machine occupying a large space, 
bang in the middle of the living room. It’s got a couple of cylinders, a faucet at the bottom of one. Red and green blinking lights.
Hathi Ram’s face says ‘What the fuck is this?!’Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 36."
"JITU

The smile on Renu’s and Jitu’s face disappears. Jitu slaps the cylinders twice.Hathi Ram shakes his head, starts walking away, but just then 
- PHOOOOSSSSHHHHHH! The machine hisses.
And a JINGLE goes off in the machine. The lights blink. And 
finally, after another PHOOOOSSSSHHHH and POP, the faucet spews out a fizzy, transparent drink.
Jitu hands the glass to Hathi Ram. He takes a sip.

Chhodo na kahaan puraani baatein le ke baith gaye...
Just then, Sid walks in.
JITU
Bhaanje! Aa jaa baith. Drink lega?
HATHI RAM
Pagal hai kya? Chhota hai abhi.
(to Sid; authoritative)
Jaa. Tu andar jaa.
Sid rolls his eyes.
INT. HATHI RAM'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT 2.46 2.46
Sid walks in and heads straight to- *
Hathi Ram’s pants on the hanger. The wallet sticking out.Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 39."
"Sid peeps out. All clear.
He tiptoes to the pants. Pulls out the wallet, takes three 
hundred rupee notes, before depositing the wallet back.
As he is about to turn back, he notices - Hathi Ram’s gun in 
the holster. 
With tentative hands - he pulls out the gun. Feels it. The 
cold metal. The weight. 
He looks at himself in the mirror. Ooh, it feels so cool!His finger goes to the trigger. Slowly - it wraps itself 
around it. Just as we slowly TRACK IN... CLOSE. Real close.
INT. / EXT. JAMUNA PAAR POLICE STATION - DAY 2.47 2.47
BANG! Ansari slams the phone receiver. Rushes to - 
HATHI RAM’S DESK:
Ansari hands over a chit to Hathi Ram.
ANSARI
Sir wo registration office se 
address mil gaya... us Tope Singh waale ghar ke owner ka. Main dekh ke aata hoon.
Hathi Ram looks at him - still a little sullen. And then takes the chit -
HATHI RAM
Main khud jaaunga. Tum dekho wo phone mila kya paani mein...?
Ansari watches him go. A bit crestfallen.
EXT. JAMUNA PAAR POLICE STATION - DAY 2.48 2.48
As Hathi Ram walks out, he passes by -
Some of the constables sipping tea. Bhati, with a sling 
bandage around his arm from the fall that he took, is the center of attraction.
CONSTABLE BHATI
Ek toh anaari, upar se miyaan. Ab is ko doosre Miyan bhai ko pakadne bhejoge toh yahi hoga.
TOKAS
Arey ye Kashmiri musalle toh aur *
bhi kattar hotey hain! *
(MORE)Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 40."
"Wo Chaudhary saab ne jab 
interrogation mein us Kabir ko katua bola thha toh kaise sulgi thi iski.
And then they see Hathi Ram. He stares them down. They disperse awkwardly.
Hathi Ram thinks. Then walks back in and SHOUTS OUT so as to 
let everyone hear.
HATHI RAM
ANSARI!
Ansari looks up from his desk.
ANSARI
Sir.
HATHI RAM
Chal, late ho raha hai.
Ansari - surprised. And then hurries after him, smiling.
EXT. SHAUKI MAMA’S HOUSE - COURTYARD - DAY 2.49 2.49*
Pictures of gods all around. SHAUKI MAMA - Chaaku’s uncle - 
seems like a pious family man as he talks to Hathi Ram and Ansari. Pictures of Guru Ravidas around.
A MENTALLY CHALLENGED SON, 20, sits in a corner, blankly 
watching flies buzz off the mosquito racket he is holding.
SHAUKI MAMA
Flat diya rehne ko... saath kaam pe lagaaya... Socha set ho jaayega munda. Mera bhi kal ko kaam sambhaalne waala koi ho jaayega. Par uska dimaag toh kahin aur hee thha. Dhandhe mein bhi ghotala kiya. Kya karta? Nikaalna pada.
HATHI RAM
Kab ki baat hai?
SHAUKI MAMA
Chaar cheh maheene pehle. Tab se koi contact nahi hai jee. *
Hathi Ram and Ansari exchange a glance.
HATHI RAM
Kabhi kisi ‘Masterji’ ka naam suna uske moonh se? Ya koi Vishal Tyagi?
Shauki thinks. Then shakes his head.TOKAS (CONT'D)
Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 41."
"SHAUKI’S WIFE enters with two cups of tea.
SHAUKI’S WIFE
Manaa kiya thha inko. Itna bada 
kaand kar ke aaya tha gaaon mein 
fir bhi inhone rakha.
Hathi Ram looks at her.
HATHI RAM
Kaisa kaand?
SHAUKI MAMA
(hastily)
Jee wo sab detail hamein nahi pata. 
Museebat mein thha bachcha. Mama hoon, madad toh karni padti hai...
Shauki’s wife rolls her eyes. And just as she is to turn away-
HATHI RAM
Tope Singh ke baare mein aur kis se pata chal sakta hai?
The wife stops.
SHAUKI’S WIFE
Chacha hai jee uska, gaaon mein. Badi banti hai dono mein. Chaache ko sab pata hoga.
Hathi Ram turns to Shauki Mama this time.
HATHI RAM
Naam?
SHAUKI MAMA
(sighs)
Mahipal Singh. Pind Haveliyan.
INT. JAMUNA PAAR POLICE STATION - SHO’S CABIN - DAY 2.50 2.50
Hathi Ram and Ansari stand in front of SHO Virk.
SHO VIRK
Punjab? Punjab kyun?
HATHI RAM
Sir investigation ke liye. Zaroori nahi hota toh aap se nahi kehta...
SHO VIRK
Zaroori hai toh tum jaao na. Ansari abhi naya hai...42."
"HATHI RAM
(hesitates)
Sir wo kya hai na... main aaj raat 
hee Chitrakoot jaa raha hoon.
Virk looks at him sharply.
SHO VIRK
Ye kab bataaya tumne?
HATHI RAM
Wo Sir... Bhagat Sir ka order hai.
SHO VIRK
Arey haan. Hathi Ram Chaudhary ke 
order toh wahaan se aate hain na 
aaj kal.
He turns to Ansari. Fixes him with a gaze and a smile that’s more a warning.
SHO VIRK (CONT’D)
Theek hai bhai, jaao. Ab 
headquarter se order hai toh kya 
kar sakte hain...
Ansari cringes.
INT. HATHI RAM'S HOUSE - DAY 2.51 2.51
Renu packs Hathi Ram’s bag. Clothes, toiletries, snacks, head 
massager. Muttering instructions all along - 
RENU
Kal nashte tak toh pooriyan chal jaayegi. Ulta seedha mat khaana, fir gas ho gayi toh sar dukhega...Waise head massager bhi rakh diya hai.
Hathi Ram nods as he checks his wallet. Something’s amiss.
HATHI RAM
Kuch paise liye kya tumne?
RENU
Nahin toh. Kyun?
Hathi Ram’s suspecting eyes go to Jitu - spread on the sofa.
HATHI RAM
Ek-do din bola tha. Aaj chautha din hai.
Renu gives him a mock glare.43."
"RENU
Kya problem hai? Jaa rahe ho na 
waise bhi tum...
And then she walks to him and gives him a hug. With the door open, it’s kinda awkward for them.
RENU (CONT’D)
Sambhal ke jaana. Aur peena mat.
EXT. BUS DEPOT - NIGHT 2.52 2.52*
Note: Change in scene location.
*
ON a ‘quarter’ of rum.
Sitting at a bench - Ansari and Hathi Ram mix it in a Coke *
bottle.
ANSARI
Sir shaayad hamein Bhagat Sir se 
hee permission leni chahiye thhi mere jaane ki...
HATHI RAM
Arey wo Chitrakoot ko le ke hee manaa kar rahe thhe... aur fir ye Taariq wala kaam ho gaya...
Hathi Ram shakes the bottle and takes a swig. Nice!
ANSARI
Ek baat poochhun Sir?
Haathi Ram looks at him.
ANSARI (CONT’D)
SHO saab ki aap se koi personal 
khunnas hai?
Hathi Ram lets out a smile.
HATHI RAM
Virk se ek aadh saal senior hoon main. Uski training mere under hui thhi... Okhla mein. Itna laind thha ki Fuddu Singh bulaate thhe usey.
(chuckles)
Maine hee rakha tha naam.
Hathi Ram takes another swig and offers to Ansari who refuses-
ANSARI
Sir padhna hai...
Hathi Ram shakes his head.Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 44."
"HATHI RAM
Par saala gotiyaan fit karne mein 
tez thha. Nikal gaya. Hum wahin reh gaye. Okhla, Okhla se Kadkadduma, Fir Outer Jamuna Paar... paataal lok ke permanent niwaasi!
He looks out into the dark of the night - glum.
HATHI RAM (CONT’D)
Fir do saal pehle jab SHO ban ke yehaan aaya, toh apne cabin mein bula ke kahaa - ‘History apni jagah hai, Chaudhary. Par sab ke saamne mujhe ‘Sir’ bulaana. Discipline ki baat hai...’ 
(beat)
Tab pata chalaa... bhenchod Fuddu Singh toh main hoon.
Hathi Ram takes a swig and looks at Ansari - the hurt in his eyes clearly visible.
HATHI RAM (CONT’D)
Ye case bahot zaroori hai mere liye, Ansari...
Ansari nods and takes the bottle from him. Ansari raises it, as if to say ‘Cheers’, and takes a sip.
A moment.
EXT. DELHI HIGHWAY TO CHITRAKOOT - MOVING BUS - NIGHT 2.53 2.53
The bus zips through the highway at night.
Hathi Ram lies wide awake - staring out into the darkness, 
sipping from his bottle.
Things on his mind.
EXT. DELHI HIGHWAY TO JALANDHAR - MOVING BUS - NIGHT 2.54 2.54
Under the dim light of the overhead LED bulb, Ansari studies. 
Despite the uncomfortable seat and the snoring co-passenger.
EXT. YAMUNA RIVER BANK - DAY 2.55 2.55*
It’s dawn. The early morning rays shine over the Yamuna 
waters, littered with plastic bags. It’s all calm.
And just then - POP!The Diver emerges from the water, gasping.Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 45."
"But this time, he has not come out empty-handed.
In his hand is the object he was searching for in the depths 
of the Yamuna - that yellow phone that belongs to Chaaku!
       FADE OUT.      
                                      ROLL IN END CREDITS. *46."
