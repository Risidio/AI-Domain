1 EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING
The hustle and bustle of a wide downtown Los Angeles street,
people going about their early morning business. Further
along the street, to the side, there is a grand looking
apartment building. Many police vehicles are pulling up and
many police officers are already standing outside, looking
up at the vastness of the building. There are many floors
and many windows across each floor of the building. The
occasional gust of wind blows a curtain in one of the more
central windows, close to the top of the building, revealing
brief glimpses of a man in a very unlucky situation.
CUT TO:
2 INT. APARTMENT - MORNING
A YOUNG MAN, sweaty and disheveled, is standing on a
glass-top coffee table, his eyes clenched tightly shut as he
struggles. His feet, hands, head and shirt are bloodied. He
is gagged and his hands are tied. There is a noose around
his neck. Little of his face is visible. He opens his eyes,
and has a crazed look in them. He is groaning, crying and
trying to break the bindings on his hands. There is a YOUNG
WOMAN lying dead on the bed next to a telephone, she’s
bleeding from the throat. A bloodied knife lies on the
coffee table at the Young Man’s feet. Suddenly, the phone
rings. The Young Man struggles more intensely to free his
hands. The call goes to answer phone - a woman, in a
strained voice, leaves a voice message.
ANSWER PHONE
Hey, I couldn’t get through to you
at your place, or on your mobile,
so thought I’d try here...
The Young Man makes muffled curses through his gag,
struggling even harder. The glass top of the coffee table
begins to crack underneath his sweating feet.
ANSWER PHONE (CONT’D)
Basically I’m just a little
concerned about your lack or
attentiveness right now. You tell
me you want this job, but not
showing your face this morning
tells me something else, and I
really don’t have time for this
kind of fucking lack of enthusiasm

The cracks in the coffee table’s glass top spread further.
The Young Man tries to shout in response to the message. The
radio alarm clock by the bed suddenly breaks out in a pop
song.
ANSWER PHONE (CONT’D)
I’m just really disappointed. This
whole thing has been a complete
fucking-
There is a loud banging at the front door of the suite.
POLICE (O.S.)
This is the police. Open up!
They begin to charge at the door, making a loud thud.
ANSWER PHONE
I hope in time these feelings I
harbor will all pass, but right
now, as far as I’m concerned,
you’re probably better off out it -
The front door is forced open, just as the glass top of the
coffee table shatters. The Young Man hangs in mid air, red
faced and choking, his throat gripped by the noose.
ANSWER PHONE (CONT’D)
Goodbye my love.
The message ends. The Young Man continues to choke, fighting
for his life. The pop song continues to play, as armed
police officers fill the room, surrounding The Young Man.
NARRATOR (ADAM) (V.O.)
What you’re asking yourself is: How
the hell could this much bad luck
befall this poor, helpless man?

A doorbell sounds and his concentration is broken, he turns
away from the mirror, throwing down the manuscript he’d been

the hall stubbing his toe along the way. Adam opens the
front door. Standing outside with some shopping bags is his
friend SETH, the owner of the apartment, a slightly shorter,
smartly dressed, well groomed man of the same age. Seth
immediately regards Adam with a look of false concern.
SETH

Adam turns his head to hear what Seth has to say before

Seth walks back into the room concerned. He approaches the
back of Adam’s chair with a kitchen towel over his shoulder.

A beautiful woman in her mid twenties to late thirties,
ANASTASIA, enters the long room, pulling the door shut
behind her. Mallory, a woman in her late sixties, refined
and well attired, stands behind her desk smoking a
cigarette, with her back to Anastasia. Anastasia pauses for
a moment and pulls the door shut a second time, harder this
time.
MALLORY (O.S.)
My love, come and sit with me.
Anastasia walks down the long room towards Mallory’s desk,
Mallory moves around to embrace her firmly and kiss her

Mallory’s desk. Mallory turns to sit on the other side

trusted. If your father and brother

ANASTASIA
They aren’t. Dad’s busy some place
as always, and Dexter’s dead, ma.

Don’t ever say that. None of us

The two women look at each other hard for a moment.
ADAM (V.O )
Let’s back up a little here...
CUT TO FLASHBACK:
5 INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
A vast, yet minimal, empty warehouse. A car with tinted
windows and lights on drives slowly through the open
warehouse doors. It crawls steadily through the wide loading
bay.
ADAM (V.O CONT’D)
The most dangerous of all LA crime
families that we are currently
running for our lives from weren’t
always embittered cunts. Now you
see them as they are, at odds with
the exhausted police department
they once owned.
A car is already parked in the warehouse, with its trunk
open. A MAN stands at the trunk counting bundles of bills
into a sports bag.
(CONTINUED)"
"CONTINUED: 9.
ADAM (V.O CONT’D)
No; all the greatest powers in
history have eventually destroyed
themselves from inside out, and
that’s exactly the fate that befell
the Latif Organization shortly
after I got involved.
Leaning against the parked car is a very smartly attired man
in his early thirties, this is DEXTER LATIF JR. He watches
the tinted car finally come to a stop, yet still some
distance away from him. The car’s lights go out.
ADAM (V.O CONT’D)
However, the seed was planted many
years prior, when Boss, Dexter
Latif Sr., left his only son and
heir, Dexter Latif Jr., in charge
of the organization, while he saw
to business overseas. A story that
fast became legend in the LA
criminal underworld.
The doors to the parked car open. From the driver’s side,
out steps JONAH ELMS (early 40s); a smartly dressed deputy
with handcuffs and a gun on his belt, and from the passenger
side Elms’ brother ISAAC ELMS (late 40s), shabbier dressed,
the then police commander. From the rear doors two DEPUTIES
also exit the car. The four men start walking through the
large warehouse towards Dexter Junior, who remains leaning
against his car.
ADAM (V.O CONT’D)
Junior was a competent, young,
golden boy, complete with a law
degree. And the corrupt LA cops had
taken a liking to him, not least
their commander, one Jonah Elms,
and his brother Isaac, the chief of
police; who saw Junior as a means
to control the mob and end LA crime
once and for all.
The man shuts the trunk of the parked car. He throws Dexter
Junior the sports bag. Dexter Junior catches it and weighs
it in his hands. He stays leaning against the car, enjoying
making Jonah and Isaac walk the distance.
ADAM (V.O CONT’D)
However, one night at their usual
meeting place, in the midst of
Junior paying Elms and Isaac off
for turning a blind eye to their

usual drug trafficking and what
have you, and the Latif
Organization’s clubs and
restaurants around town, there was
a sudden problem.
Just as Jonah and Isaac reach Dexter, the fire sprinklers
above their heads suddenly rain down, soaking Dexter, Jonah,
Isaac, and their two deputies.
JONAH ELMS
Fire sprinklers raining gasoline...
My wife wanted me to stay home
tonight, and look what I would’ve
missed...
ISAAC ELMS
What the fuck is going on here?
DEXTER LATIF JR.
I don’t know...
The warehouse doors slam shut, MEN masked with balaclavas
and armed with shotguns step out of the side door panel of
the warehouse, followed by two BIKERS in leather biker gear
wearing their biker helmets with the visors pulled down. The
First Biker locks their sights on Dexter Junior.
DEXTER LATIF JR.
Take off that helmet you fuck! I
only got time for faces...
The First Biker turns to the Second Biker and nods to them
in a mechanically distorted tone.
BIKER HELMET 1
Your time is up, Dexter Latif.
DEXTER frowns with dismay. The Second Biker pulls a pistol
almost from nowhere and fires it into Dexter’s knee cap. He
falls to the ground screaming in agony. Jonah catches
Isaac’s eyes and nods towards the car. As the two cops run
towards it, Issac catches a bullet in his knee falling to
the wet floor in pain. Jonah narrowly avoids the Bikers’
shots and gets behind the wheel of the car. The First Biker
turns back to the passageway they came through, while the
Second Biker lights up a zippo flame. The Elms Bros deputies
are both shot to the ground. Jonah looks back at Isaac.
ISAAC ELMS
Drive, you dumb fuck!
(CONTINUED)"
"CONTINUED: 11.
Jonah reverses hard out of the warehouse as the Second Biker
tosses the zippo onto the gasoline soaked floor, engulfing
Dexter Junior and Isaac in flames, as the men in balaclavas
fire shots at Elms’ speeding vehicle smashing through the
closed warehouse garage entrance. He watches in rage as the
Bikers disappear behind the flames, and he hears the sounds
of Isaac and Dexter Junior screaming as they burn to death.
ADAM (V.O)
Jonah Elms tried to save his
brother, but it couldn’t be helped.
Blaming himself for Isaac’s death,
he hit the bottle hard, which cost
him his marriage and custody of his
only child. Believing the massacre
to be an inside job delivered by
the Latifs, he sought revenge on
them for his brother’s life and the
family he had lost. No one in the
LAPD believed Elms that the Latifs
would assassinate their own, and he
hatched plans to get justice for
his brother another way. The
remains of the two men in the
warehouse were never found; and
apparently, the Latifs still hold
out hope that their son and heir
will find his way home one day,
turning it all into just a bad
dream. And on that day Boss Dexter
Latif Sr. will return from his
extended vacation...

Mallory hangs up the phone and looks Elms over. Elms looks
down to the already open contract papers laid out on the
desk in front of him. One of Mallory’s guards walks around
the desk to offer Elms a gold-nibbed fountain pen. Elms
hesitantly takes the pen and signs his name on the dotted
line of the paper. Mallory continues to stare at Elms. Elms
places the pen on the desk and smooths his hair back out of
his face nervously. The guard takes Mallory’s copy of the
contract and walks back round. Elms slowly rises and
stretches out his hand to Mallory. Mallory pauses then
shakes it, looking at him with her deep, unblinking eyes.
Mallory’s eyes then turn in the direction of the uneasy
looking police deputy, then back to Elms, smiling.
MALLORY
It’s done. But blood is better than
ink...
Mallory looks at Elms sternly. Elms looks uneasy for a
moment. Mallory breaks into a laugh.

A few of the other actors look at him, frowning, with looks
of shock and concern.
ADAM (CONT’D)
I never needed anybody else to tell
me that I’m the best thing since
Laurence Olivier, not my agent, not
some casting director, not my drama
school peers or the fucking
gobshite tutors who ’always knew
best’! Truth be told I’m sure I was
a better actor before drama school,
a more fearless actor at least.
The other actors continue to stare at him.
ADAM (CONT’D)
Mostly because I didn’t really know
what I was meant to be afraid of
before... Sure as hell didn’t
anticipate what I was meant to be
afraid of now either... But nothing
really prepares anyone for falling
in love with the wrong woman...
Adam aggressively crushes his empty paper coffee cup in his
hand and throws it on the floor. He glances up to see one of
the other actors speaking to the CASTING ASSISTANT, a
smartly dressed woman with an iPad, pointing his way. She
walks over to him.
CASTING ASSISTANT
Hi..
ADAM
Hi!

She checks her iPad.

Tell you what love, honestly, I
didn’t sleep too well last night,
my missus kept hogging the duvet,
I’m stressed as fuck about this
audition, and I’d love another cup
of coffee...
Adam beams and she softens to his charms.
CASTING ASSISTANT (CONT’D)
No problem. I’ll go get it, Adam.
She turns away from him with a smile, disappearing into
another room. He turns back to us, beckoning us in closer.
ADAM
Think I learnt that in drama
school?
Adam winks at us with a grin. He notices a couple of the
other actors looking back at him with annoyed expressions.
ADAM
Hurry up then lads! Ain’t got all

Has the operation been difficult

The jobs aren’t easy like they used

Adam walks into a room in front of a panel of two MEN and
two WOMEN, several feet between him and them. The casting
assistant with the iPad walks in and whispers something in
one of the woman’s ears before walking out again, smiling at
Adam as she passes him. Adam smiles back before dropping his
eyes to the floor. The woman the assistant spoke to looks
through some notes while the other three stare at Adam, then
she looks up.

Yep that’s me.

Hello Adam. Thank you for coming

The laughing man glances over at the squinting man. The
squinting man raises his head up to speak.
PANEL MAN 1
I am.
ADAM (CONT’D)
Fucking awful. You need to hire
yourself a writer pronto, mate.
The panel gaze at Adam in astonishment.
ADAM (CONT’D)
And I’ll tell you why; I’m having
one of the worst weeks of my life,
right. I’ve split up with my
girlfriend because her mad mother
hates me, and I’m still in love
with her by the way - the
girlfriend that is, not her mother.
I’m sleeping on a mate’s sofa doing
my nut in thinking about what my
girl might be doing in my absence,
when I should be sleeping at night.
My bank account is about to go into
the red, as my agent is about as
competent as a sack of shit,
completely incapable of putting me
up for an audition worth attending.
And on top of all that fucking
bullshit, if your script was worth
anything to an average movie goer
like me, it would have kept my mind
off my melodrama this week, just a
little a bit, but, in truth, it
fucking didn’t, mate... It just
made me wanna get through this
audition all the sooner. But saying
all that, I’m broke and I’m the
best actor you’ve auditioned all

reached. This man can’t tell us
anything we don’t already know.
OLD MAN
I’m sorry, you’ve known this for

Your priority was to make an
impression, and it looks like
you’ve made an impressive start.
I’ll press it further. In any case

Can you drown that out?!
The Woman on the computer hits a few keys and gradually the
sound of exquisite classical music fills the room. The
Victim is now sat in a chair, too weak to sit up straight,
dripping with blood, now untied and ungagged. Mickey watches
him closely whilst rubbing his chin. The lights set up
around the Victim suddenly blaze, building with the musical
crescendo.
MICKEY (CONT’D)
Would you like a cigarette?
The Victim lifts his head.
VICTIM
Yeah.
Mickey extends his hand holding an open silver cigarette
case. The Victim takes one and Mickey quickly lights it for
him with a zippo.
MICKEY
Do you have anything you wish to
tell me?
Alejandra, at Mickey’s side, loads a video tape into a
camera she has on a tripod pointed at the Victim. She hits
record.
ALEJANDRA
Rolling!
The Victim sits up looking bewildered and fearful, revealing
himself to be the Young Deputy, previously seen with Elms in
Mallory’s office. Mickey taps on the needle of a full
syringe before gazing back at him, hard. Then, slowly, he
breaks into a soft smile and masks his face with a black
voice distortion device that covers his nose and mouth.

Elms (Jonah) enters an empty apartment, turns on the lights

calling someone, but to no avail; it’s just a woman’s answer
phone message. He picks up a framed photograph of him with a
woman and baby, solemnly, he has another drink.

Elms lies in a drunken doze on his couch. A freshly used
glass and an empty bourbon bottle standing tall on his
coffee table. His TV displays a fuzzy screen and classical
music plays softly from a stereo. The table is littered with
criminal investigation report files marked confidential. The
files draw together a vague network of Mallory-related
murder and theft cases - as revealed by the attached
photographs in mug shot format of some familiar faces; The
Old Man, The Middle Aged Man and Alejandra.
Suddenly the doorbell rings and there’s a bang on the door.
Elms is awoken and he rises, putting his specs on. He
retrieves a gun as he quietly walks to the front door. He
looks through the spy hole pointing the gun barrel against
the door. He sees and hears nothing. He cautiously opens the
door and then looks down to see a parcel on the floor. He
bends down to pick it up before walking back to the living
room.
He sits down and slices the side of the package with a
letter opener and lets the contents slide out onto the
table. A video tape. Elms looks down at it. It is marked
with the words ’Judicial’. He picks up a remote to mute the
music and uses a plastic glove to pick up the tape and push
it into his VHS player. The fuzzy screen changes to black,
then a countdown before cutting to an extreme close up shot
of Elms’s young deputy withered in the chair, pathetically
smoking the cigarette Mickey had given him. Elms leans
forward in shock.

No, as a tutor of the method I

ADAM
Why?
MICKEY
Because it’s unfortunate that in
order to promote the study of
Shakespearean acting, academics
feel that they need to attack the
Stanislavsky System, and its
American derivative, Method acting.
Classical theater deserves the
spotlight in acting classes, and
our dear old teacher referred to
Method Acting, as I recall, as ’An
over-reliance on a personal
emotional reality, to the exclusion
of all else’. That is a vast
misrepresentation. He was a fool.

why you called me at silly o’clock
to arrange a meeting, so you could

gag. Mickey starts chewing gum, he places his gun next to
him on the table and taps his fingers with agitation.
MICKEY

Are you going to scream?
HOSTAGE
No, not now.
MICKEY
The reason why I’m the last resort
for my employer with clients like
you, and situations like these, is
because I’m unpredictable. But
tonight I’m tired, tired of my
unpredictability, so I’m just gonna
ask you a few questions up front.

a bullet fires through the Girl’s Boyfriend’s face with
blood and brains splattering Adam, the Girlfriend and those
around them. The hands of the dead Boyfriend release Adam as
the body drops to the dance floor, at the force of Adam’s
gunshot. The music from the stage peters out as screams of
horror echo throughout the room.

122 INT. NIGHTCLUB - EVE
Adam turns around towards the foot of staircase back up to
the entrance, his gun still pointed, to be greeted by Mickey
and his men standing at the top of the staircase, guns
drawn. Mickey now wears his distortion mask. The dance floor
falls silent.
MICKEY

Let’s dance?
Adam shoots the Middle Aged Man beside Mickey. Mickey turns
to look at the body for a moment. Adam turns back running
into the crowd.
MICKEY (CONT’D)

Kill him.
Mickey’s remaining men raise their guns and fire at Adam,
hitting many of the crowd of dancers, more blood splatters
Adam as they take bullets that are meant for him. Mickey
moves down the staircase and stops on the dance floor.
MICKEY (CONT’D)
(distorted)
You can run...
Mickey raises his gun to the crowd, gesturing them to move
out of his way as he follows Adam. Adam sees an exit door to
the rear of the stage, he runs and climbs up onto the stage,
bullets narrowly missing him. He grabs the pop Singer, now
lying face down center stage, and pulls her up. He presses
his gun into her head, she cries out. Adam speaks into her
microphone for all to hear.
ADAM
(through sound system)
Stand them down, Mickey! Stand them
down now! Don’t make me do it...
There’s a pause. Mickey and his men
hold their guns on Adam. Mickey’s
phone vibrates. He calmly answers
it.

Mickey hangs up, lowers his gun, turns back to the others
and nods. The others lower their guns.

Mickey drops his gun, the rest follow.
ADAM (CONT’D)

If any of you move, she dies...
The crowd of People below the stage is still. Adam drags the
pop Singer back towards the stage exit door. She’s terrified
and in tears. When he gets to a few feet away from the door,
he lets her go and quickly exits; the sound of the stage
door slamming shut echoes through the room. Mickey looks
around him, and very slowly claps his hands together in
amazement.

The Car Owner hands his keys to Adam.
CAR OWNER
Look pal, I can’t afford to lose
this vehicle.
ADAM
Thanks.
Adam gets in the driver’s seat and starts the engine. He
quickly pulls away from the curb and drives fast down the
street. He glances up into the mirror realizing he still has
the blood splattered mask on. He pulls it off. Somewhere
between anger and tears, he drives on into the night, away
from the crime scenes he created."

125 EXT. LA FREEWAY - DAWN
After driving for what feels like hours Adam drives along
the dried river bottom of the LA River. He is driving back
towards the Downtown skyscrapers as dawn breaks over the
horizon. The road has felt quiet for some time. He turns the
radio on; a pop song plays. One of the Biker Helmet
Assassins swerves in behind Adam on a slick motorcycle. Adam
catches sight of them in his mirror. Assuming they’re
involved with the Latifs he steps on the peddle hard,
speeding ahead. The First Biker follows close behind. Adam
makes a turn and can’t see the Biker in his mirrors anymore.
He smiles. Suddenly a Second Biker Helmet Assassin pulls
into view ahead of him. He makes a sudden turn breaking
through fencing and down into the LA River.
CUT TO:
126 EXT. LA - RIVER - DAWN
The First Biker catches him up again on the river bed.
ADAM
Fuck.
Gun shots are fired from behind him. He keeps driving fast.
The Second Biker stands before their bike on the river bed
ahead of him. The First Biker still a hundred yards to his
rear.
ADAM
Get out the way you cunt.
The Second Biker pulls a gun and shoots through Adam’s tire,
forcing him to a screeching halt. The Second Biker lowers
their gun and stands watching Adam through their visor. Adam
picks up his gun and steps out of the vehicle. He walks
forward, pointing his gun at the Second Biker. The First
Biker quickly cruises in behind Adam knocking him out cold
with the butt of their gun as he drives ahead of him. Adam
hits the ground with a bloody head.

doors close.
CUT TO:
129 INT. SKYSCRAPER LOUNGE - NIGHT
The elevator dings as the doors open and Adam cautiously
steps out into a vast lounge, naked in the halflight. One of
the Bikers is standing, surveying the city through the vast
window. Adam tries to take a step backwards, but the Biker
turns to face him. A couple of balaclava wearing HENCHMEN
close in around Adam from the sides. They also pull knives.
The elevator doors close behind Adam. There’s a pause as
Adam waits for one of them to attack.
The First Henchman slashes at Adam, but Adam dodges and
grabs their arm. The two men struggle with one another until
Adam takes a gash to the arm. Enraged, Adam slashes back,
cutting the First Henchman’s face before landing his blade
in their throat.
The Second Henchman quickly moves in on Adam as he catches
his breath. Adam punches him hard in the head and slashes
his wrist, causing him to drop his blade. Adam grabs him by
the throat choking him to death slowly, before stabbing him
in the face, again and again. The Biker watches motionless
from the window at the far end of the room. Adam lets the
Second Henchman drop to the floor, bloodied and dead.
Crouched he looks up sweaty and menacingly at the Biker.
ADAM
You think I don’t know who you are.
Come here. Don’t make me walk over
there.
There is a pause. The Biker doesn’t move.
ADAM (CONT’D)
Alright you cunt.
Adam rises, walking over to the Biker wearing a helmet, his
knife pointed. As he gets close the Biker pulls a gun and
shoots Adam through the chest. Adam chokes with blood,
moving quickly at them with the knife. Adam takes another

skyscrapers.
ELMS (O.S)
You heading somewhere?
ADAM turns to see ELMS stood by his police vehicle, lent
against the open passenger door. The WAITER COP sits inside
behind the wheel eating a burrito. ADAM smirks.
ADAM

ELMS
That’s good because we’re headed
that way anyway. Save you some

ELMS flashes his police badge.
ADAM

ELMS
Oh the charges are; abuse, assault,
aggravated assault, assault with a
deadly weapon, and auto theft...

Adam grins and reaches for his gun. Elms pulls his gun on
Adam and cocks it before Adam can draw his and smirks.
ELMS

Adam glances to the Waiter Cop who has put down his burrito
and has his gun pointed at Adam as well.
ELMS (CONT’D)
Do you wish to speak to me?
Elms smiles. There’s a moment of pause and Adam nods gently.

Elms tosses a pair of handcuffs in Adam’s direction.

Adam frowns at Elms turning his cuffed wrists. Elms laughs
reaching for his keys.
ELMS (CONT’D)

Elms unlocks Adam’s cuffs. Adam takes a drink from his
coffee mug. Elms does the same.
ELMS (CONT’D)
Now I’m in a dilemma about you... I
could go by the book and throw you
in jail, but I’ve never gone by the
book. To tell you the truth I’ve
never been a good cop, I got to
where I am today by breaking the
law not serving it, ironic as that
may be... I could give you back to
the Latif Crime Family, which I
know would make Mallory’s day at
this point, as you’ve caused her a
whole bunch of trouble... But you
know, I never wanted to give them
my protection, the scum. I just
wanted to keep them under closer
watch, just waiting for my moment
to destroy every last one of those
cunts... It was my fault for making
deals with them in the first place,
deals that cost my brother’s life,

MALLORY (V.O.)
Basically I’m just a little
concerned about your lack or
attentiveness right now. You tell
me you want this job, but not
showing your face this morning
tells me something else, and I
really don’t have time for this
kind of fucking lack of enthusiasm
ya know?... Are you there? Is
anybody there?! I’d really like to
talk about this!... Well, fuck it.
The cracks in the coffee table’s glass top spread further.
The Young Man tries to shout in response to the message. The
radio alarm clock by the bed suddenly breaks out in a pop
song.
MALLORY (V.O.)
I’m just really disappointed. This
whole thing has been a complete
fucking-
There is a loud banging at the front door of the apartment.
POLICE
This is the police. Open up!
They begin to charge the door.
MALLORY (V.O.)
I hope in time these feelings I
harbor will pass but right now, as
far as your current efforts at life
go, you’re probably better off
dead-
(CONTINUED)"
"CONTINUED: 112.
The front door is forced open just as the glass top of the
coffee table shatters. Mickey hangs in mid air, red faced
and choking, his throat gripped by the noose.
MALLORY (V.O.)
Goodbye my love.
The message ends. Mickey continues to choke for his life.
The pop song continues to play throughout the room. Elms,
the waiter cop and some armed deputies fill the room.
WAITER COP
We’d better cut him down quick
boss!
Elms looks at the bubble gum popping concierge’s corpse, as
the others check her pulse.
ELMS
No. He’s fine where he is. It’s
what he wants. Shut that shit off
will you.
The waiter cop turns the alarm clock radio off. Mickey
continues to choke. Elms walks close to him and watches the
last moments of Mickey’s life drain away. He turns to the
others.
ELMS (CONT’D)
Toss the place. Send a memo to the
station that we found Latif at the
hotel but were too late to take him
alive.
The waiter cop looks confused.
WAITER COP
Who’s she?
Pointing to the bubble gum popping concierge.
ELMS
Probably just one of his whores.
WAITER COP
Latif...
ELMS
Dexter Latif, Senior.

158 INT. MALLORY’S OFFICE - DAWN
Adam, pressing the gun against Mallory, as she finishes the
voice message.
MALLORY
Goodbye, my love.
ADAM
Well done. Now hang up.
Mallory hangs up the phone. Adam smiles.
ADAM (CONT’D)
You’re finished.
Mallory laughs before swinging a knife at Adam, landing it
in his shoulder. Adam knocks her out with the butt of his
gun and she falls across the desk unconscious. Adam takes
Mallory’s seat. He painfully pulls the blade out from his
shoulder and tosses the bloodied weapon to the desk. He
rests his head back in the chair exhausted, and looks over
at the mystery door at his side. He rises and walks over to
it, opening it.
159 INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
Walking into the restaurant he met Mickey in, the room is
full of many many people all staring at him. Everyone is
present; Anastasia, Mallory, Mickey and the Old Man. Still
clenching his gun Adam looks around the room. Suddenly the
room erupts into applause with everybody grinning and
cheering at his success. Adam smiles awkwardly back. He
catches Alejandra’s piercing stare amidst the crowd.
JUMP CUT BACK TO:
160 INT. MALLORY’S OFFICE - DAWN
Adam suddenly wakes to find himself still sat at Mallory’s
desk. His vision adjusts to see a Biker wearing a helmet,
one hand behind their back, and two of Mallory’s Henchmen
standing either side of them.
ADAM
It’s a bit warm in here for head
gear?
BIKER HELMET 1 (MECHANICALLY DISTORTED
VOICE)
Bueno.
(CONTINUED)"
"CONTINUED: 114.
Adam looks surprised for a second, and then smiles softly
into a knowing smirk. The Biker pulls their helmet off to
reveal herself as Alejandra. She brings her other hand from
behind her back to reveal Mickey’s voice distortion mask.
Looking down at it with a gentle smile, Alejandra throws it
in Adam’s direction. It lands on Mallory’s desk in front of
Adam, beside the black and white mask he brought with him.
Mallory begins to come to. Alejandra quickly pulls his gun
on Adam, but Adam’s is already pointing at Alejandra.
ALEJANDRA (CONT’D)
You need to make a phone call.
ADAM
Why?
ALEJANDRA
Confia en nadie... Trust no one...
Alejandra smirks.
ADAM
Mickey goes down for Latif’s
crimes-
ALEJANDRA
And the murder of a young woman,
earlier tonight...
ADAM
Anastasia’s alive?
ALEJANDRA
I didn’t mean her.
CUT TO FLASHBACK:
161 INT. APARTMENT BUILDING 2 CORRIDOR - NIGHT
The Concierge walks down the corridor popping gum.
Alejandra, in her helmet, waits quietly around the corner of
a door frame. She grabs her as she passes by, quickly
cutting her throat.

162 INT. APARTMENT BUILDING 2 - NIGHT
Alejandra drops the concierge’s corpse down on the bed. The
struggling, gagged Mickey glimpses Alejandra and tries to
shout to her through the gag. Alejandra smiles and calmly
moves towards him, she kneels down and picks up Mickey’s
mask. She looks up at Mickey.
ALEJANDRA
Shh..
Mickey continues to make muffled attempts to shout and
struggle as Alejandra turns to exit the room.
BACK TO:
163 INT. MALLORY’S OFFICE - DAWN
Alejandra is laughing. Adam looks back at Alejandra
menacingly.
ALEJANDRA
You need to make a phone call.
Adam gently shakes his head.
ALEJANDRA (CONT’D)
Try on Mickey’s mask. I’m sure
it’ll suit you.
ADAM
Mickey goes down for Latif’s
crimes, and the murder of a young
woman tonight, and you take the
keys to his kingdom.
ALEJANDRA
Not my keys, not my kingdom...
The door behind Alejandra and one of the Henchmen opens it.
A Second Biker wearing a helmet walks into view. Their voice
is mechanically distorted.
BIKER HELMET 2
You’ve done well Adam. I dare say
you’ve surpassed all
expectations...
ADAM
Take off that helmet.
The Second Biker pulls off their helmet, Anastasia’s flowing
hair falls from beneath it.

"CONTINUED: 116.
ADAM
Ana?!
Anastasia stands behind Alejandra, wrapping her arms around
her and kissing her cheek.
ALEJANDRA
Her’s Adam... Her kingdom, her
keys... But the real key was you,
always you... Now, you’re going to
pick up that phone and turn
yourself in, for Mickey’s crimes,
and your’s... Put on the mask.
MALLORY
Kill the fucking rat, sweetie.
Adam presses his gun against Mallory’s head.
ANASTASIA
Shut it, Ma.
Anastasia looks disappointed in her mother and ex-boyfriend.
A figure walks into the room from behind all of them slowly.
Adam laughs to himself
ADAM
Ana I wanna hear you say it.
ANASTASIA
What?
ADAM
Deny that you killed your brother.
Adam presses the gun harder against Mallory’s head.
ADAM (CONT’D)
Go on bitch, deny it! Because it’s
all crystal to me now. Deny it!

The dark figure behind them moves closer into view.
Anastasia turns. Mallory smiles hysterically with relief as
she sees who it is.
ANASTASIA
Dad...
DEXTER LATIF SR. a smartly attired man in his late 60s walks
to the side table to pour himself a scotch, seating himself
down in an armchair and taking a sip of the drink. Mallory
struggles beneath Adam’s gun.
MALLORY
Welcome home darling...
DEXTER LATIF SR.
Not the welcome back party I had in
mind...
Dexter Latif Sr. stares off into the distance as he drinks
ANASTASIA
We weren’t expecting you.
DEXTER LATIF SR.
You killed Junior?
He turns his head abruptly to face Anastasia.
Alejandra smiles walking towards Adam, her gun still
pointed. She stops. They both cock their guns. They stare
into each other’s eyes.
ALEJANDRA (CONT’D)
This is your time, amigo.
ADAM
One step closer, and the old lady
dies.
DEXTER LATIF SR.
You squeeze that trigger kid, and
you’ll have a lot more to answer
for than crashing my welcome home
party, I tell you.
ADAM
Fuck you old man. Who called you?
Dexter Latif Sr. laughs at Adam’s spunk and opens a flick
knife before taking another sip of his drink.

They all continue to stare at each other, locked in a moment

Adam begins walking solemnly to the door to leave. He opens
the door and turns to Seth in the hallway.
ALEJANDRA (V.O.)
This is your time, amigo.
Adam notices a copy of the manuscript he was rehearsing at
the flat before.
ADAM (V.O.)
If the clocks could be turned back,
if I could change what I have
done... Listen to me!... listen to
me... look at me, look at me!!
Adam turns to face Seth.
ADAM (V.O.)
I’m sorry...
SETH
Do you know when you’ll be back?
ADAM
I don’t know if I will be back
tonight.
SETH
Well, you’re always welcome to your
own party.
Seth smiles softly at Adam, who smiles back. They embrace
and Adam turns, slowly exiting and pulling the door closed.
167 INT. APARTMENT BLOCK CORRIDOR - NIGHT
Music can be heard from a neighboring apartment. As Adam
stands in the long, wide corridor. Adam’s tired eyes are
dropped to the ground before glancing up at us.
ADAM
Showtime.

"CONTINUED: 119.
Adam breaks into a grin at us before carrying on down the
long and wide corridor to exit and face his enemies in the
Latif Organization. He keeps walking further and further
away from us until he has disappeared from our view
altogether. The lights flicker for a moment.
FADE TO BLACK.
