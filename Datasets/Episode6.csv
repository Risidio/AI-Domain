"FADE IN:
INT./EXT. TRAIN - SLEEPER CLASS COACH - NIGHT 6.1A 6.1A*
Note: Changed from Day to Night. *
A train in motion. We’re in the sleeper Class coach of the 
Indian Railways. 
The usual chatty atmosphere. Somewhere, a group of O.S. girls 
play antakshari.
IN A COUPE :
GHULAM MASOOD, 38, and his two SONS - aged 15 and 5, the *
little one intently drawing a little sketch on a newspaper. *
Ghulam’s beard and the skull caps of the two boys give away 
their Muslim identity.
Apart from them, a LADY and her DAUGHTER, 15, are also in the 
coupe.
From behind the comic books that they’re pretending to read, 
there seems to be some sort of an eye-contact going on between the two 15-year olds. And the O.S. song seems to complement their state of mind -
GIRLS IN COUPE (O.S.)
(singing)
Aashiqui mein har aashiq ho jaata 
hai majboor,
Isme dil ka, mere dil ka, isme dil ka kya kasoor...
But the Lady catches on to it. She glares at her daughter, who gets the message and turns away - awkward.
The boy is disappointed. The Lady glares at him with 
hostility.
The train slows down a bit. Oblivious to all that’s going on, 
Ghulam Masood peeps out and tells his boys -
GHULAM MASOOD
Lagta hai koi station aa raha hai. 
Chalo khaana khaate hain. Chai mil 
jaayegi saath mein...
He takes the newspaper the boy was drawing on and spreads it *
out."
"Dainik Bharat. December 1, 1992. An ominous looking headline 
stares at us - ‘Kar Sevakon ki toliyan nikali Ayodhya ki 
ore’.
As the train approaches a platform - Ghulam Masood takes out 
a dabba from his bag and opens it up on the newspaper.
The Lady glances at the open dabba with suspicion. Looks like 
a meat dish. Her eyes go wide in disgust and her saree pallu 
instinctively goes to her nose.But it’s not enough. She retches and tries to control herself *
but just can’t, and ends up vomitting on the floor. *
She rushes to the window. And lets the rest of it out. *
Ghulam and his sons look  at her - not understanding what’s *
going on.
GHULAM MASOOD (CONT’D)
Aap theek ho, behenji?
He offers her some water from a bottle. But she refuses to 
even touch it as she continues to vomit.
The slowing train has reached the platform now.EXT. PLATFORM - NIGHT 6.1B 6.1B*
Faces. Dangerous looking. Around their foreheads - saffron 
bandanas. Slogans can be heard in the bg - 
CROWD AT STATION
Ram lala hum aayenge, Mandir wahin 
banaayenge...
The train comes to a grinding halt right in front of them. And the faces stare at us with the hostility of a mob in heat.
FADE TO BLACK:
TITLE APPEARS - ‘Of Fathers and Sons’.
OPENING CREDITS ROLL.

Note: Location changed. *
INT. BATLA HOUSE - DILAPIDATED BUILDING - PROPERTY DEALER 6.3A 6.3A
OFFICE - DAY *
The PROPERTY DEALER, a middle-aged man clad in white clothes, *
sits reading a newspaper when he sees Hathi Ram and Ansari *
walk in. *
Hathi Ram sits down like he owns the place. Pins the Property 
Dealer with a cold gaze.
It unsettles the Property Dealer a bit.
ANSARI
Sir flat check karne aaye the. Sab 
theek hai na? Kisi ne entry wentry 
toh nahi ki andar?
PROPERTY DEALER
Kaisi baat kar rahe ho Sir? Sealed 
property hai. Notice lagaa hai CBI 
ka darwaaze pe. Aur fir hum bhi toh 
baithe hain rakhwaali ko.
(to his staff)
Chhotu chai la saab logon ke liye. *
Hathi Ram signals a cold ‘no’ to the STAFF with a slight 
shake of his head.
ANSARI
Us flat ki koi duplicate chaabi wagairah toh nahi banwa ke rakhi 
na? Abhi bhi padi hai toh de do.
PROPERTY DEALER
Nahi, nahi, sir. Dono copy toh aap 
log le gaye the. 
Ansari nods. Looks at Hathi Ram - who just quietly observes the Property Dealer.
The Property Dealer almost feels an urge to explain himself.
PROPERTY DEALER (CONT’D)
Sir hum toh bilkul professional 
kaam karte hain. 
(MORE)Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 3."
"Khud apne saamne agreement banwaaya 
tha un logon ka. Paper poore thhe 
saalon ke... Kaise pata chalta? 
(beat)
Par jaise hee unki photo TV pe 
dekhi, maine seedhe CBI waalon ko 
phone ghumaaya...
ANSARI
Ye agreement kab sign kiya tha?
PROPERTY DEALER
Pichhle maheene ki baarah tareek 
ko. Yaheen isi kursi pe baithi thi 
wo Nepalan. Baithi baitha jo bhi 
hai. Shakal itni innocent par kaam 
dekho...
Hathi Ram spots something  - a CCTV camera.
Just then, his phone rings. Hathi Ram answers it.
VOICE FROM THE OTHER SIDE (O.S.)
Sirjee yeh TV pe Cheeni ke baare 
mein jo bhi bol rahe hain... sab 
bakwaas hai. Wo koi Nepali agent 
wagent nahi hai...
Hathi Ram notices - the Property Dealer looking at him.
HATHI RAM
(into the phone; casual)
Kaun?
VOICE FROM THE OTHER SIDE (O.S.)
Purani Dilli station pe milo. Ek 
ghante mein.
The phone gets disconnected. Hathi Ram gets up and trying to be casual shakes the Property Dealer’s hand.
HATHI RAM
Department ki help karne ke liye 
shukriya.
The confused Property Dealer nods as Hathi Ram walks out.

"HATHI RAM (CONT’D)
CCTV camera laga hai office mein. 
Agar baarah tareek ko uss kursi pe 
baith ke agreement hua hai toh uski 
recording bhi hogi.
Ansari nods.
ANSARI

EXT. OLD DELHI RAILWAY STATION - PLATFORM - DAY 6.4 6.4
The Fruit Stall we had been to earlier with Hathi Ram. A 
figure awaits there. It’s the Dark Man we’ve seen hanging around the police station a few times. KAALIYA, 27.
His eyes go to - Hathi Ram and Ansari coming down the bridge. 
Hathi Ram stops as he notices him.
BY A TEA STALL
:
A SMALL KID serves them two cups of tea.
HATHI RAM
Tu station pe bhi aaya tha na usey 
dekhne? Dost hai tera? Rishteydaar 
hai?
KAALIYA
Bachpan se jaanta hoon saab. Yahin 
mila tha.
HATHI RAM
Yahaan?
A wistful smile comes up on Kaaliya’s face.
ANGLE ON them from the adjacent platform as a train rumbles 
in.
KAALIYA (V.O.)
Train number pandrah hazaar nau sau nau. Awadh Asaam Mail.
We STAY ON the same FRAME. We can see glimpses of Kaaliya and Hathi Ram through the oncoming train.Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 5."
"KAALIYA (V.O.)

DAY
Note: Location changed.
*
LITTLE KAALIYA (10) who we saw as the ROUGH KID in Episode 4, *
jumps into the train, pushing his way past the last few *
exiting PASSENGERS. As he starts to look under the seats for *
empty plastic bottles, his eyes go to - *
An 8-year old boy crying in a corner. We’ve seen him earlier *
as the CUTE KID in Episode 4. We now know he’s LITTLE CHEENI. *
Kaaliya ignores him, and goes back to what he was doing. But 
a while later - his eyes go back to the poor, lost kid. *
Kaaliya walks up to him.
LITTLE KAALIYA
Naam kya hai tera?
Cheeni just continues to cry.
Kaaliya reaches into his sack and fishes out a banana. He offers it to Little Cheeni - Who refuses to touch it. Or 
to stop crying. 
Kaaliya looks increasingly frustrated as he tries to talk to 
Little Cheeni but we don’t hear it. Instead, we hear -
KAALIYA (V.O.)
Maa baap mar gaye toh mama ne bina 
ticket train mein bitha diya, bola 
tere liye ice cream leke aata hoon. 
Train chali, bhosadi ka mama bhi 
chala gaya. Poore saath ghante 
train mein rone ke baad bhi saale 
ke aaansoo khatam hee nahi hote 
the.
Little Kaaliya gives up. Sighs!
LITTLE KAALIYA
Ek aur aa gaya maraane! *Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 6."
"EXT. LOHA BRIDGE - DAY 6.6 6.6*
Evening. Under a bridge. Kaaliya and GUDIYA, 10, counts their *
plastic bottles while Cheeni sobs in a corner.
DHAKA, 12, checks the wallets they’ve stolen. He gives a 
fifty to Kaaliya and a few tenners to Gudiya. And then, he finds a photo in the last wallet.
DHAKA
Saale ne itni andar chhupa ke *
rakkhi hai. Yeh pakka iski biwi ki 
toh nahi hai.
He takes out something from his gunny bag. A collection of similar photographs. He adds the latest to the collection.
He notices - Cheeni’s eyes are on him.
DHAKA (CONT’D)
Main pocket nahi maarta. Connection 
banaata hoon. Samjha Cheeni?
Kaaliya and Gudiya look at him.
LITTLE KAALIYA
Cheeni?
DHAKA
Toh aur kya? Main Dhaka se toh 
Dhaka. Yeh Cheen se, toh Cheeni.
LITTLE KAALIYA
Accha hua London se nahi aaya.
They laugh.Tears continue to flow from Cheeni’s eyes.
LITTLE KAALIYA (CONT’D)
Kya ladki jaise rota hai! Chal 
tujhe jaadu dikhata hoon. 
Cheeni stops weeping out of anticipation.Kaaliya reaches into his gunny sack. And brings something 
right next to Cheeni’s face. It’s his two- mouthed snake.
Cheeni is scared out of his wits. Cries out even louder.Dhaka has had enough. In a flash - Dhaka grabs him by his  
mouth and forces a rag on to his nose.Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 7."
"DHAKA
Sun be Cheeni. Yehaan agar zinda *
rehna hai na, toh rona bandh kar, *
aur soonghna shuru kar. *
Cheeni resists, but has no option but to sniff it. And as he 
breathes - his eyes widen slowly.
Kaaliya smiles. And everything SLOWS DOWN. And we TRANSITION 
to a SONG-based MONTAGE. *
‘STATION RATS’ MONTAGE *

And damn - Kaaliya’s besotted.
LITTLE KAALIYA

Complete with the hand mudras and the beatific smile.
Kaaliya and the gang shout - 
LITTLE KAALIYA
Cheen ki mata! Cheen ki mata!
The passengers turn to look at them. Some murmur in doubt - 
DOUBTING PASSENGER
Ye Cheen ki kaun si mata hoti hai?
Kaaliya and the gang freeze. But a FERVENT BHAKT comes to 
their rescue.
FERVENT BHAKT
Arey Jammu ke aage Cheen hee toh padta hai. Aksai Cheen...
(does ‘pranaam’ to Cheeni)
Dekho kaisi bhavya chhavi hai...
Dhaka and Kaaliya sense this opportunity to SHOUT - 
DHAKA AND LITTLE KAALIYA
Bolo Cheen ki Mata ki -
PASSENGERS

"A laughing Dhaka looks up. And his eyes meet - a tall, bald 
menacing figure - SHAAKAL.

Dhaka’s smile slowly vanishes from his face.
INT. OLD DELHI - SEEDY VIDEO PARLOUR - NIGHT 6.10 6.10
Dark room. A 90s Bollywood song plays on a TV. *
Kaaliya and Cheeni sit on the floor in a corner, watching it 
without blinking.
Nearby, someone jerks off on a spread out newspaper.Cheeni’s hand makes its way towards Kaaliya’s. Cheeni puts *
his head on Kaaliya’s shoulder. But just then - *
The curtains part. Kaaliya turns to see -Dhaka stands in the silhouette. *
DHAKA
Chal Cheeni.
Kaaliya gets up.
LITTLE KAALIYA
Kahaan?
DHAKA

dekhne nahi aaya main...
DHAKA
Chhod, Kaaliya. Baat samajh. Jaana toh padega.Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 11."
"LITTLE KAALIYA
Kyun jaana padega?
Dhaka stops. He turns towards Kaaliya but can’t look him in 
the eye as he says - 
DHAKA
Shaakal ne bulaaya hai.
Fuck - the light goes off Kaaliya’s face.
Sound of the music continues in the bg. Kaaliya pleads - *
LITTLE KAALIYA
Dekh Dhaka, ye... ye chhota hai 
Dhaka... ye mar jaayega Dhaka... 
kuchh kar... pleej... kuchh kar...
Dhaka pushes him in anger.
DHAKA
Koi nahi marta Kaaliya. Tu aur main bhi itne hee thhe. Marey kya?
He starts to pull Cheeni away again. Kaaliya watches them go - tears brimming in his eyes.
Until - Cheeni turns to look at him.Their eyes meet.Kaaliya runs towards him. And jumps on to Dhaka. And SCREAMS -
LITTLE KAALIYA
BHAAG CHEENI! BHAAG!
Before Dhaka can understand anything, Kaaliya is all over 
him, pinning him down with kicks and punches.
A stunned Cheeni remains rooted. Until, Kaaliya SCREAMS again-
LITTLE KAALIYA (CONT’D)

Shaakal thrusts wildly at her from behind, but the rag 
stuffed in Cheeni’s mouth stifles her screams.
IN A CORNER - Shaakal’s gang sits smoking heroin off a foil.After a while, Shaakal appears there. Signals to one of his 
men - ‘your turn now’.
The man makes his way towards Little Cheeni, while Shaakal 
sits down to smoke some heroin.

them. And sits down.
Kaaliya can’t meet her eye. He quietly passes her a rag.Cheeni puts it next to her nose. And sniffs hard.The three remain sitting there for a long time. All quiet.CLOSE ON Little Kaaliya’s face - stoic. Not giving away 
anything.
KAALIYA (V.O.)

Hathi Ram and Ansari look at Kaaliya.
HATHI RAM
Kya kaam karwaata tha Talreja usse?
KAALIYA
Bas usko Talreja ke aadmiyon ke 
saath gaadi mein baith ke bag ki delivery dene ya lene jana hota. Ladki gaadi mein bathi ho toh family samajh ke checking nahi hoti...
ANSARI
Bag mein kya hota tha?
KAALIYA
Hawaala ka paisa. Kabhi Meerut, kabhi Lucknow, kabhi Agra...
Hathi Ram looks at him.

Jaane kya karna chahti thhi paanch laakh ka bhosadi waali...
HATHI RAM
Pichhle maheene ki baarah tareek ko woh kahaan thi yaad hai?
Kaaliya thinks, shakes his head. Then pleads.
KAALIYA
Kuchh karo saab. Hum log Purani Dilli station ke keede hain saab. Ye Nepal, Pakistan... ye sab se kuchh lena dena nahi... please usko bacha lo saab...
Hathi Ram and Ansari don’t know what to say as an emotional Kaaliya folds his hands in front of them.
INT. TIHAR JAIL - BARRACKS - DAY 6.16 6.16*
Cheeni walks into the barracks - behind Tyagi, Chaaku and *
Kabir. *
All around her - ROUGH MEN. Heads turn. Men stare at her, 
with a mix of hostility and lust.
As she nervously looks for an empty place to sit down - a row *
of PRISONERS come towards her.Cheeni can notice the inmates smirking at her effeminate 
ways.
Her eyes go to - a BALD MAN. He grins at her.She coils into herself as she crosses these men with 
trepidation, looking lost and vulnerable.Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 15."
"EXT. RAJU'S BHAIYYA'S HOUSE - DAY 6.17 6.17*
A nervous Sid walks towards Raju’s building, led on by a *
FRIEND.
SID’S FRIEND
Jaldi chal na, Raju Bhaiyya gusse 
mein hain.
Sid hesitates, but the friend pulls him along. Behind - a car *
rolls into the courtyard. *
INT. / EXT. RAJU’S BACHELOR PAD - DAY 6.17A 6.17A *
The room has been turned upside down by Raju who looks *
clearly on the edge as he rummages through cupboards and almirahs and what have you.
Finally, he turns to the neighbourhood boys assembled there.
RAJU BHAIYYA
BHENCHODON! Sirf tum logon ko pata 
tha ki ghar pe gun hai...
The boys have no response. Raju goes from one to another -
RAJU BHAIYYA (CONT’D)
Kisney lee? Bol? Tuney lee?
And just then, a voice comes from downstairs - *
HARYANVI BOUNCER ONE (O.S.) *
RAJU!!! *
Raju rushes to the balcony to see - *
The menacing looking ANIL BHAI and his two HARYANVI BOUNCERS *
standing downstairs in the courtyard. *
EXT. RAJU'S BHAIYYA'S HOUSE - DAY 6.17B 6.17B *
Sid watches as a tentative Raju Bhaiyya reaches downstairs *
and slowly walks up to Anil Bhai. *
RAJU BHAIYYA *
(blabbers)
Mil... mil jaayegi Anil Bhai. Yehin kahin... yehin kahin hai...
(points to the boys)
Laundon ne idhar udhar kar di...Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 16."
"Anil Bhai stares at Raju. And then - out of nowhere - grabs 
Raju’s testicles and squeezes them.
ANIL BHAI
Ke laagya re bhai tanne? Taabar ke khelne ki cheej sa? Hain? Tuney ke bol ke lee thhi? Bataa...
Raju’s face - all red. Looks like he’s going to faint. But Anil Bhai won’t let go.
ANIL BHAI (CONT’D)
BATAA!
RAJU BHAIYYA
(in great pain)
Wo... vasooli karni thi, kisi ko dhamkaana tha...
Anil Bhai turns to the boys - 
ANIL BHAI
Ke vasooli kari Raju ne bandook dikha ke? Gaand li tamhaari? Hain? Gaand dete ho is ne?
The boys stand frozen in fear. Sid’s sweating buckets.
Anil Bhai finally lets go of Raju. And he collapses to the 
floor, holding his testicles.
ANIL BHAI (CONT’D)
Do din. Do din ke baad thaare aand mhaare haath mein nahi, mhaari plate mein honge Raju. Aur jo ye tere baalak hain, ye khaayenge Raju ka special anda fry. 
As Anil Bhai turns around - His eyes meet Sid’s. He points to the bandage around Sid’s head.
ANIL BHAI (CONT’D)
Je chot kaishe lag gayi? Dhyaan rakha kar pappu...
As Anil Bhai caresses his head and walks out - a shiver runs down Sid’s spine. He looks shaken.
INT. HATHI RAM'S HOUSE - NIGHT 6.18 6.18
A fresh chapaati rises on the gas burner . A sullen Renu walks 
out with it to the living room -17."
"Where a glum Hathi Ram sits eating. She’s about to put it in 
his plate - but he quietly refuses without looking at her.
Renu walks back to the kitchen without saying anything. The 
tension between them palpable in the air.
Just then - a shaken Sid walks into the house. He looks at 
Hathi Ram, and pleads -
SID
Papa... wo gun...
Hathi Ram doesn’t say anything.
SID (CONT’D)
Papa please de do... Maine jisse li hai chup chaap uske ghar mein waapas rakh doonga. Baat khatam ho jaayegi.
HATHI RAM
Pehle naam bata uska. Dekhoon toh kaun hai jo bachchon ko gun chalaana sikha raha hai...
Sid goes quiet.
Hathi Ram gets up and goes to the kitchen. He puts the plate 
in the sink. Mumbles without looking at Renu -
HATHI RAM (CONT’D)
Waapas aane mein der ho jaayegi.
Renu doesn’t respond.
He picks up his keys and is about to walk out. But stops.He turns and goes to the bedroom. Unlocks the steel almirah.Renu watches as Hathi Ram takes out the gun from the locker, 
and stuffs it behind his trousers.
RENU
Suspended ho na? Toh ye gun le ke kahaan jaa rahe ho?
HATHI RAM
Tere pe bharosa nahi hai. Tujhe apne bete se kuchh zyaada hee pyaar hai...
RENU
Kisi ek ko toh karna padega na.18."
"Hathi Ram gives her a sharp glance. And storms out.
Renu too huffs her way to the kitchen and angrily switches 
the LIGHTS OFF.
INT. SANJEEV’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT 6.19 6.19*
A light is SWITCHED ON.
A drunk Dolly walks up to the mirror, and stares at herself. *
It looks like she has been crying. *
She stares at herself for a long time. Then leans closer to 
the mirror and stretches the skin on her face.
Not as smooth and firm as it once was.She looks at her breasts. Then grabs them and lifts them up. 
She holds them there for a bit. But the moment she lets go of them, they sag down again.
She just stands there staring at herself. Until she hears - The sound of the bedroom door opening.Sanjeev walks into the bedroom. *
Puts his phone down on the bedside table. *
Dolly stumbles up to him. Sanjeev can see she’s not in a good *
state. *
SANJEEV *
Are you alright? *
Dolly doesn’t reply. Instead - she just starts kissing him. *
Sanjeev’s a bit taken aback by the suddenness of it. *
He plays along for a bit. But when Dolly doesn’t stop, *
Sanjeev gently pulls himself away. *
SANJEEV (CONT’D) *
Baby, I am tired. *
But Dolly doesn’t stop. She moves closer to him again. *
Clearly not in the mood - Sanjeev tries to move away, but she *

sense of uneasiness. Her eyes are on Sanjeev - 
Who is in command of the floor.
SANJEEV
I think we’re digressing a bit 
here. The question that we’re today seeking an answer to is simple. ‘Is there a larger conspiracy here to shake the foundations of the Indian Republic?’ In other words, was I, Sanjeev Mehra, the only target or is there a longer list of potential targets that the enemy had in mind? And if yes, what is it that the government is doing to protect its prominent citizens? We’ll get back to it after this very short break.

"HATHI RAM (CONT’D)
Bol beta. Kuchh nahi kahunga.
Hathi Ram tries to appear calm, but there’s a streak of manic 
anger in his eyes.
HATHI RAM (CONT’D)
Bol na beta. Kisne kiya ye?
A scared Sid gives in.
SID 
Raju Bhaiyya.
Hathi Ram storms to the cupboard. Takes out the gun. *
Then walks back to Sid and pulls him out of the blanket. *
HATHI RAM
Chal mere saath...
RENU
Bukhaar hai ise... kya kar rahe ho? 
Dimaag kharaab ho gaya hai... mere 
bachche ko kuchh hua na...
She tries to stop him. Hathi Ram pushes her away. But she pushes him back. 
RENU (CONT’D)
Jab dekho tab apni manmaani karoge kya... Sunaayi nahi de raha? Kahin nahi jaa raha ye...
They reach the living room in the tussle. Renu pulls at his *
hand hard. And in a moment of rage, Hathi Ram SLAPS her.
Renu just stands there - stunned.Hathi Ram takes Sid by the hand, and walks out.

EXT. RAJU BHAIYYA’S HOUSE - STAIRS + LANE OUTSIDE - NIGHT 6.51B 6.51B *
Hathi Ram drags Raju Bhaiyya down the stairs, while slapping *
and kicking him mercilessly. *
HATHI RAM
Pistol chahiye tujhe bhosdi waale? Haan, pistol chahiye? *Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 40."
"RAJU BHAIYYA
Meri Pistol nahi hai...
Hathi Ram kicks him. Raju goes tumbling down the stairs.
HATHI RAM
Toh kiski hai, haan?
RAJU BHAIYYA
Anil Bhai ki... *
HATHI RAM *
Kaun hai? Baap hai tera? Chal bata *
kahaan rehta hai... *
They reach the bottom of the stairs - where Ansari stands *
with Sid. Some of Sid’s neighbourhood friends watch the *
scenes from a distance. *
HATHI RAM (CONT’D) *
(shouts to Ansari) *
Ansari... Rickshaw rok! *
Ansari manages to flag down a passing autorickshaw. *
EXT. DELHI ROADS - MOVING AUTO - NIGHT 6.51C 6.51C *
The auto rides on the night roads. Sid steals a glance at his *
father. Hathi Ram’s face - hard. *
EXT. ANIL BHAI’S KOTHI - ROAD OUTSIDE + COMPOUND - NIGHT 6.52 6.52
A dimly-lit kothi. The rickshaw stops in front of it.
Hathi Ram jumps out and drags Raju along. Sid and Ansari 
follow. 
TWO BURLY MEN at the gate try to stop Hathi Ram - But Hathi Ram KICKS one in the balls. Then PUNCHES the other 
in the face. It’s swift and brutal and both men go down.
Hathi Ram rushes into -THE COMPOUND
:
The two Haryanvi Bouncers emerge out of the house. But before 
they can realise the situation - 
Hathi Ram goes at them like a bull. Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 41."
"Sid just stares without blinking as his father takes on these 
dangerous looking men.
Ansari watches the scene cautiously, but when one of the 
earlier men try to go at Hathi Ram from behind - 
Ansari tackles him and throws him to the ground and keeps him 
pinned there.
Just then, a SHOUT comes from inside - 
ANIL BHAI (O.S.)
Ra ke ho rya sa baahar?
And Anil Bhai steps out. And looks at his men - all flattened 
out.
Hathi Ram looks at Raju - Who nods in fear. Yes, it's him.
Hathi Ram takes the gun out from behind his trousers. He walks up to Anil Bhai and stuffs the gun in his pants, 
right at his crotch.
HATHI RAM 
Yeh rahi teri pistol. Tera mera hisaab baraabar. Ab iske baad agar tune ya tere kisi bandey ne mere bete ki taraf aank utha ke bhi dekha na, toh isi pistol se gotey udaa dunga tere.
Anil Bhai stares back at him with cold eyes.
ANIL BHAI
Do kaudi ke inspector. Tanne toh main - 
HATHI RAM
(cuts him; in Haryanvi)
Ab suspend karaane ki dhamki mat diyo bhai. Wo kaam kisi aur ne pehle hee kar diya.
The stare game continues for some time. And then -
Hathi Ram turns around, takes Sid's hand, and walks away. 
Ansari follows cautiously.
Sid continues to just stare at his father, like he’s seeing 
him in a totally new light.42."
"EXT. DELHI ROADS - MOVING AUTO - NIGHT 6.53 6.53
The auto drives on empty Delhi streets.
And Hathi Ram is still RAGING -
HATHI RAM
Chutiye hain hum, jo in chutiyon ko 
apni manmaani karne dete hain... suspend karwa doonga... lund karwa doonga fund karwa doonga...
He realises Sid is listening. Hathi Ram snaps at him.
HATHI RAM (CONT’D)
Tu kya sun raha hai? Kaan bandh kar apne.
Sid obeys. And Hathi Ram continues with his rant, like he can't help it.
HATHI RAM (CONT’D)
Chutiya bana ke rakha hai kab se... ye ISI hai... ye terrorist hai... falaana dhimkaana... Investigation kar rahe hain yaa duniya ko chutiyaa banaa rahe hain apne baapon ke liye... *
EXT. HATHI RAM’S HOUSE - LANE OUTSIDE - NIGHT 6.54 6.54
The auto comes to a stop.
Hathi Ram is still at it.
HATHI RAM
Sahi jaa rahe thhe hum... par ek 
galti pe saalon ne case le liya.
A waiting Renu runs straight to Sid and pulls him out.
Hathi Ram continues to rant as he steps out of the auto.
HATHI RAM (CONT’D)
Aur ab khud baith ke gaand fula 
rahe hain saale -
When Renu steps forward. And SLAPS him.
Hathi Ram stands there - jolted.Renu turns around and takes Sid inside.Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 43."
"Hathi Ram continues to just stand there - stunned, awkward.
Next to Ansari - who’s just as awkward.Dead silence. And then, Hathi Ram’s phone rings.It takes Hathi Ram a while to recover, and answer.
HATHI RAM (CONT’D)
Hello?
Ansari watches as Hathi Ram’s face goes grim.
INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT 6.55 6.55
Kabir’s dead body lies on a hospital bed. JAIL OFFICIALS and 
DELHI POLICE COPS mill about.
OUTSIDE IN THE CORRIDOR
: REPORTERS and CAMERAMEN kept at bay 
by yawning cops.A little away - Hathi Ram and Ansari stand next to Sara.
SARA
Jail officials ke hisaab se wo 
bladebaaz mentally unstable hai... But I think ye ek paid job thha.
Anger and frustration rises on Hathi Ram’s face.
HATHI RAM
Toh CBI ko bataao. Apne us boss Sanjeev Mehra se baat karo, jo TV pe kuchh bhi bakey jaa raha hai. Mujhe kyun bata rahi hain aap?
Sara too snaps at that. Angrily looks for something in her bag.
SARA
Kyunki aap ki diary padh ke lagaa ki aap CBI ya Sanjeev ki terrorism waali theory se agree nahi karte. Aap ki enquiry ka main focus Kabir ya wo ladki nahi, Vishal Tyagi tha.
She hands over to Hathi Ram - his diary. Hathi Ram looks at her with surprise.
BY A BENCH
:44."
"Hathi Ram and Ansari sit with Sara. She has a n I-Pad open and *
is showing to them photocopies of newspaper reports and 
pictures she has compiled.
SARA (CONT’D)
Maine thodi research ki, is case se related political connections ko le ke. UP mein Jiji ki government mein ek powerful minister hai - Balkishan Bajpayee. Chitrakoot mein Tyagi ka boss Gwala Gujjar iske liye kayi saalon se kaam karta hai. Bajpayee jab PWD minister thha, Gwala ne usse kayi road contracts uthaaye thhe...
Hathi Ram scrolls through the newspaper cuttings and pictures *
of Jiji, Bajpayee and Gwala Gujjar.
HATHI RAM
Sanjeev Mehra ka Bajpayee ya is Gwala se kya connection hai? Wo log usey kyun maarna chahte thhe?
Sara shakes her head.
SARA
I don’t know. My wild guess is, Bajpayee ki party kayi saalon se national presence banaana chahti hai. Lok Sabha election aane waale hain. Unhe ruling party ke khilaaf koi mudda chahiye thha. Maybe Sanjeev is right about this bit - that his killing was part of a larger plan. Shaayad unki list mein aur bhi naam hon...
Hathi Ram continues to scroll through the file. When at one *
moment - he suddenly stops. Then goes back to the earlier photograph. Enlarges it. *
He peers at it closely.
IN THE PICTURE - Behind Bajpayee and Gwala Gujjar stands -
Rajbir Gujjar, in a cop uniform.
Hathi Ram looks intrigued. Murmurs -
HATHI RAM
Ye toh... Rajbir Gujjar hai.
Ansari looks at him.Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 45."
"HATHI RAM (CONT’D)
Tyagi ka sports teacher. Par isne 
ye toh kabhi nahi bataaya ki ye kabhi police mein thha, aur Bajpayee ki security mein bhi...
Hathi Ram stares at the picture with cold eyes.
FADE OUT
ROLL END CREDITS *46."
